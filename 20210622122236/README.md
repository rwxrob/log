Reading about <https://determined.ai> HP purchase. I suppose you know ML
has gone mainstream with HP gets into the game. The list the three model
development training frameworks as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Been
following that race from a distance before eventually jumping in and
training my own learning models. Also noticed TensorFlow Serving,
something in the Seldon space for delivering and deploying model
results. I get the sense that Seldon is best of class there.
