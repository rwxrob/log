Just noticed that Twitch followers dropped two after streaming a lot of
fish and just doing quiet work on stream. It always makes me chuckle a
bit at how fickle people are --- particularly people on Twitch. I can
dedicate all of my Sunday morning to making content easier to read and
questions easier for people to find, but a certain type of individual is
simply not entertained enough to stay engaged. Fuck em'. There are
plenty more who appreciate it. I always have to remember that those who
actually put in the time to keep up with the boring shit I write and
content I produce end up with 100k starting salary "junior" developer
jobs. Those who put in the effort will be rewarded in ways the pleebs
who can't be bothered by a boring terminal stream will never fucking
understand.
