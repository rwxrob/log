Google Cloud Platform has more AI/ML offerings and focus than all the
others from the looks of it today. That puts them *way* ahead as more
developer shops are being replaced with machine learning development
shops. The eventual end-game is that developers will be replaced with AI
in general. Some day we'll just be tuning criteria and policy for AIs
that do everything to fully the needs of any system. Kubernetes
"policies" are a beginning toward that end. Policy-based applications
development will be a first step toward AI actually creating the
applications themselves.
