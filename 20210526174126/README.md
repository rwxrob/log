Working on two important detection in Helm2to3 migration. We've
concluded on the following two functions but they need further
confirmation to determine if they are the best. Internet research
confirms the first. It's remarkably surprising that Helm publishing
*nothing* about how to make these detections. The more I follow the Helm
project the more I think that team is full of shit. I am putting the
scripts in zet to see if someone else has something better.
