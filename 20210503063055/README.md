Time for me to hit the hay, as they say. But I have to confess I feel
such a burden off my shoulders knowing I have a completely sustainable
way to just dump thoughts and organize all the knowledge in different
forms that I have all over the place. It's like doing Spring cleaning or
something, so freeing.
