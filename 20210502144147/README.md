I've decided to keep all the language stuff within my personal [zet]
repo simply for simplicity. This is what others have done in the past.
Luhmann put literally everything on one of 90,000 slips of paper in his.
And all of it was within arms reach on his table with all the boxes
containing them. I need to do the digital equivalent.

One of the amazing things about using Git is that I can monitor and
track the change of thinking and ideas over time with Git revision
history.
