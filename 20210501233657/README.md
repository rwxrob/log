Looks like I got the new log script to work.

You know I sometimes worry that I will eventually hit some sort of
maximum number of directories within a single directory. But they I
remember the 36,000 user home directories on the PicoCTF servers.
UNIX/Linux can handle it. Just don't do an `ls` in there.
