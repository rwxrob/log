I'm enjoying how much Linux administration is automatically included
with the approach of starting with containers for the boost. Everyone is
immediately the master system administrator of their own little Linux
box without any danger or fear. It's amazing. It has allowed covering
things that I would never included because of the problem of resetting
everything and providing a safe environment. It means that people
learning can immediately do stuff with it and experiment.
