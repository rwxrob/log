Hilarious, I was unbanned from cyber_insecurity for a while, and went
back to see all the reasons I with chat messages about why I had been
banned because it was hilarious (all I did was count his sponsorships,
tell the chat that they didn't need to pay anything to learn all this,
no shit that was it) and discovered I had been unbanned. But now I'm
banned again and the reasons no longer appear. It appears I have been
outsmarted by the dude who was booted from Reddit for "over self
promotion". I care not. At least people will see this "channel" for what
it is.
