Go 1.17 beta is out and uses globs in description. Yet another example
of how all this knowledge crosses over. We just did *Pattern Matching*

Anyone paying attention during the Boost will immediately understand
what is meant by the braces. Clearly, the author of the Go release
document assumes a base understanding of Bash shell globbing.
