Forwarded first resume from livestream community today and had a great
conversation with my TEKSystems recruiter mostly just concerned with
flooding him with resumes that I may not have time to vet at all. He's
funny, "Yes, send them. I'll do the vetting. It's what I do." So that
means the flood-gates are open. I'll be opening calling for resume
submissions via direct Discord messages on every stream from now on at
the beginning. I'll have to make sure that people understand the only
thing I receive in exchange for sending their resumes on is good
relationship with my recruiter, those on my stream, and potentially more
people interested in joining our reputable community. I don't get one
cent of financial kick back from any of this. If people sub and sponsor,
that's the closes thing. But there is no direct correlation or quid pro
quo.
