Reading through my old Archlinux VM project I started while building out
a system for hacking/pentesting and realizing what a waste of time it
was. I always should have made it as a container of my own. I chucked
the whole lab. Maybe will revisit that again sometime. But honestly not
sure if Arch is worth the hassle. I hit a nasty bug in the main
container that requires `--privledged` in order for root to work even
though you log in as root.
