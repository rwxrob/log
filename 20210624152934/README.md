Now that I have my Smart Phone back and have given up on many of the
privacy concerns that led me to purchase a flip-phone and use it for the
last two years, I'm more inclined to return to PWA development so I can
make cool cross-mobile-platform apps, meaning that I'll likely revisit
Vue (I've thought about Svelte, but that requires buying into their
whole build environment). Probably the first app I will create is my own
KEG Zettelkasten subscriber app, akin to RSS newsreaders but better.
It's a ways down the line, but having my entire ZK repo on my phone to
instantly query by voice would be *really* nice tool to have. Then add
to that the ability to sub to others ZKs and query them as well. It must
be made.
