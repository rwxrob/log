Decided to use `zet` instead of `note` for the name of the Zettelkasten
repo. It just feels like the right thing to do. I really wish more
people know about Luhmann and all his contributions. He put an amazing
amount of thought into stuff that most people couldn't give a shit
about. Well I *do* give a shit.
