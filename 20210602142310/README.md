Realized that with the boosts starting May 4th every year that the
holidays will be predictable. That makes for some interesting
correlations. For example, I randomly went over colors on the first day
of Pride month. It is hard to celebrate Memorial day with something in
code, but I'll find something. Also, I ended up talking about liberation
from educational oppression on Cinqo de Mayo.
