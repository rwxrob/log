After watching a few other streamers for a while (while waiting for
something at work) I realized how top the quality of people on my stream
are. The fucking idiots on these other streams would drive me crazy.
Absolutely unable to think for themselves and completely responsive to
flashy lights and bouncy enthusiasm. I know that is negative to post,
but I don't give a shit. I'm so grateful for the people sending me two
page emails of gratitude for teaching them something rather than just
entertaining them.
