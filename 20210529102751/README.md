Just told "you are mean" again by another lazy asshole who feels
justified stealing my time and energy to answer a question it would take
them literally 2 seconds to search for on their own. But that would
require reading. How the fuck to these people think *I'm* the asshole?!
*They* are the entitled fucks who think I should drop everything and
give them my time and if I don't *I'm* the mean one. Pricks.
