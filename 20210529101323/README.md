Looks like cyber_insecurity unbanned me. I was sorta pissed because I
wanted to get a screenshot of the chat messages listed as reasons I was
banned. They included stuff that said, "I count 18 sponsors" and "you
don't need any of this to learn, you can learn it on your own" and "what
about Picoctf or overthewire". I was banned because I opened gave people
alternatives to his permanent advertisement for which he was banned from
Reddit because of "excessive self marketing while exceeding the number
of hacker cliches allowed for a single person" (okay that last part I
made up). He seems like a nice enough guy, just really misled and with
seriously fucked up priorities.
