The only good thing about Twitter drama (and others start) is that you
really get to see what people are like inside when they take sides on
the issue. So glad to see them reveal themselves. Oh well. I'll keep
making great content that is helping people all over the world and
calling out bad shit when I see it, no matter who does it, with wild
abandon. Meanwhile, people will continue to throw shit on Twitter. My
step-son says it just means I'm helping people that that "drama on
Twitch is always a good sign." I'm not so sure. But I do know that I
would likely agree with whatever LastMiles has to say about everything,
and the fucking ran him out of town for calling shit like he sees it
(among other more justifiable reasons). I can rest easy knowing
LastMiles would not only approve of my calling this shit out, but would
take it further, and frankly, the opinion of a fucking kernel dev is far
more important to me than the shallow squeaks of a bunch of
script-kiddies on Twitter. (And remember this is my person log, Imma say
whatever the fuck I want. It's not Twitter, people have to fucking look
for it and follow me to see it.)
