This [Twitter thread] is the reason I have to stop opening Twitter at
all. It's a stream of idiots who have no fucking idea how to do
effective Internet, web-based research advocating for their uninformed,
inexperienced idiotic methods. This is the reason Torvalds doesn't use
or look at Twitter. One look at this stupidity and I just can't get my
zen back for an hour. I cannot believe how fucking stupid people are.
Expecting these novices to do *any* decent autodidactic learning and to
research at any level of significant efficiency is just asking too much.
But then again, they all took time from their day to craft well-written
responses to a reasonable question. I vote to just not participate in
Twitter any more other than sending out notifications. Don't get mad.
Get busy, Rob. They are good people who just don't know better. I know.
I know that. But so hard not to freak out. Now watch, someone will find
this and judge entirely based off of this single log entry, 'cuz that's
what idiots do.
