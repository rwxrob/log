I've decided to put all my content into one of my Zettelkasten repos and
to make the <https://github.com/rwxrob/boost> repo itself into a ZK repo
with a bunch of external links to other things.

I'm also a bit conflicted at the moment about having a separate repo for
both `log` and `zet` but it makes sense for now. I imagine people would
not want to get hits from my `log` when searching for topical
information from `zet`. That should probably be the criteria for that.
