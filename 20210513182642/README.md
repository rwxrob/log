I need to present rwxrob/workspace at ISTE in 2022 (perhaps '21). This
method of skills education is 100% inline with how developer teams are
centralizing their development environments now. Gone are the days of a
monolithic server. Now you just create the environment you want/need
everyone to use and have everyone run a copy of it *from their fucking
laptop* whether or not they have an Internet connection. Images can be
loaded onto USBs even and distributed that way.
