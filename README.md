# Personal Log

This is my personal log of events and things with chronological
significance. Often it will contain a link to a note or some other
content that has more details. Each entry KEG Zettel Node directory
containing at least a `README.md` file (and sometimes more) with an
optional title. The isosec name of the directory is the exact moment
when the log was created in (GMT/Zulu time).
