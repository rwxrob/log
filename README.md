# Personal Log

This is my personal log of events and things with chronological
significance. Often it will contain a link to a note or some other
content that has more details. Each entry is a KEG Node / Zettelkasten
directory containing at least a `README.md` file (and sometimes more)
with an optional title. The isosec name of the directory is the exact
moment when the log was created in (GMT/Zulu time).

*Note that normally this `README.md` serves as the Zettelkasten register
but in the case of a chronological log this makes little sense. Other
Zettel nodes and registers do, however, link into this log and can do so
reliably.
