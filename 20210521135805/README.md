Vim pane splitting might be worth another look. I've been using TMUX and
screen for years to do it (mostly because that is all there was for
years). But the annoyance of having to set paste mode in Vim and
accidentally grabbing line numbers (when you don't disable them) is
getting to be enough of a reason to take another look. I don't know
though, writing quickly to a file is not that much more work and works
everywhere, including everything that uses `vi` instead of `vim`.
