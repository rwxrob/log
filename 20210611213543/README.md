I'm having a seriously longing to get back into the TOML project and
possibly code in `-o toml` support into `kubectl` and the like. My God.
It has to be done. It would remove some many problems that are cropping
up with YAML files in Kubernetes. So much clearer to read and write. It
fucking has to be done.
