The `shfmt` tool is super popular and completely falling behind in
support. There are some 700 open issues. I wish the project wasn't
implemented as bad as it is. I would love to add to it. But the code
really sucks. Add it to the list of things that could really use a redo
as a `cmdbox-shfmt` command module.
