Okay, finished the `chopme` utility for converting my year of log posts
into a directory tree organized by year, month, and day with entries in
the `README.md` files of the day.

Perhaps most notably, I learned a lot about the preferred date and time
stamp heading that will allow the most flexibility and sustainability.
For example, I added the UNIX time in seconds because the natural
language of the heading depends on the locale. This way, people can file
that information directly just by reading the heading.

I really need to invest in a good chair. I have all the other stuff,
just not a chair. The IKEA chairs are great because I usually sit in
half-lotus but perhaps one with better padding would help. I hear good
things about the Steelcase brand (better than Herman Miller imho).

On second thought, if I maintain my yoga and sit in half-lotus any
padding thing that rotates will work. I don't need to spend more than a
thousand dollars, I just need to fucking sit correctly. The end.
