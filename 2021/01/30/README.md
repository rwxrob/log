Just learned that tpope does 50/72. I feel so validated.

While discussing the *Developer Advocate* role with some people on the
stream I reflected on my time at Nike where I spend at least half my
time advocating to use SwooshNet (the Intranet web portal I had built)
after having built it. I don't I ever really identified that title in
the role. I *definitely* was a "Developer Advocate" which makes me think
that might be the major role I'm actually looking for next in a
full-time job.

I think the reason I missed this before is because I build and maintain
stuff as well as advocate for using it. There are a bunch of roles that
are mangled together so its hard to pick one. 

I've enjoyed the *results* of coding and creating IT systems more than
the *act* of creating them. In fact, it sort of annoys me. I just want
to see the vision done and usable in my hands. Coding and ops are
essential tasks in the critical path to getting these things.
