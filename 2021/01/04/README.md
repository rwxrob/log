After a member informed me his domain name is expiring and costs a lot
more to renew I got to thinking of the need for a domain at all for
young beginners, which, in turn, led me to question the very premise of
having a portfolio site at all. Here's the new information influencing
what is a new conclusion:

* Domain names cost money often going up in price
* Personal portfolio sites do not require forms or paywalls
* GitHub is the standard tech social networking service
* Most portfolio content will be in GitHub repos anyway
* Blogging (notes) on GitHub provides poor-man's RSS from updates
* GitHub Pages is now hosted on a CDN
* GitHub profiles are not provided for all accounts
* GitHub content outlives domains in the event of death
* GitHub now integrates entire discussion forum for each repo
* Git secondary origins allows push to both `github.com/<user>` and
  `github.com/<user>.github.io` repos at the same time

Consolidating all my personal and professional site content into a
single GitHub repo seems to be the logical thing to do for all of these
reasons. The repo itself is enough for many needs and adding a simple
web interface is trivial.

After reading the legal agreement for "Memberships" on YouTube I cannot
believe anyone actually agrees to it. It gives YouTube an insane amount
of power over your content and is legally binding regarding any perks
you provide (or fail to provide) to those it outlines. I imagine it is
no worse legally than similar things done with Patreon, except they take
30% (Patreon only takes about 3%). It's clearly just a power play to
lock you into YouTube. Too bad so many YouTubers won't even see it
coming.

What's worse is that it perpetuates to *any* content that has ever been
provided under the agreement. Unlike partnerships (which you can drop at
any time) you are legally required to provide the content to the patrons
for the "period" over which it was provided. In other words, because
someone legally paid for perks and content at a given level they are
permanently granted permission to that content making it unclear if you
can even remove it at all. After all, your "members" paid for it.

Maybe I've overthinking this, but I don't think so.

It's not even original. They are copying exactly what Twitch does.

Besides, the kind of people who enjoy showing off their emojis and stuff
in the stream are not the kind of people I want in the community. I'm
not rewarding such behavior. I prefer rewarding valuable, informed
knowledge contributions rather than those who pay more cash. That's the
crony capitalist kind of shit that has gotten civilization into this
mess, more capital, higher priority. Not on my stream. YouTube can fuck
right off. I'm rewarding intelligent, thoughtful contributions even if
it costs me. But I'm quite certain there are enough *good* people out
there to recognize the value of this and provide their financial support
in other ways.
