[This](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/01/robin-williamss-widow-there-were-so-many-misunderstandings-about-what-had-happened-to-him)
is why I refused to read *anything* when Robin Williams died.
I knew there would be so much more to the story and refused to make
any conclusions until I had all the facts. Now we know and can soon
watch a documentary about his condition.

[Dead Poets' Society](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Dead Poets' Society) remains the most significant film of my life.
Robin Williams was always one of the most important humans I have ever
observed, a hero in so many ways. 

From a very young age I was *obsessed* with him, an intellectual with
amazing capacity to understand the plight of the human condition and yet
able to put on a happy face despite the pain all around --- and within
--- him. 

[Mork and Mindy](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Mork and Mindy) had me laughing when, looking back, there wasn't
a lot to laugh about in my life. Mork's comic foibles as he learned to
understand humans were something I appreciated, maybe because more
was going on in my mind than I fully understood, maybe because I feel
like such an alien all the time (more today than ever).

I can't explain all the reasons and don't really want to over-analyze
Robin's impact on my life. Suffice it to say, Robin freed some part of
me as if to give me permission to be me and to be happy despite the pain
all around. 

His fate still terrifies me to this day. But even in death I
feel like he's speaking to me personally, not literally of course, but
in a way that says, "Here's how I *almost* made it through this. Now you
can understand. Do better. You can make it."

Thank you, Robin.

2020 ends with the undeniable, overwhelming --- and now very main-stream
--- importance of
[containers](https://twitter.com/DetlefBurkhardt/status/1339355170560421888).
They've been important for a while, but these days learning them fully
is just not optionally for any serious technologist, even front-end
engineers.

In other words, understanding `docker` is as important as understanding
Linux or `ssh` today. That's how fundamental those skills are.

Ran into an some info about an [old friend and
mentor](https://humanities.byu.edu/person/devin-n-asay/) who is still
working at BYU. 

(*I just had to add "BYU" to my spell check, now that's a trip.*)

Devin was hired while I worked for the Digital Humanities labs and was
enrolled in the French and Russian programs (one after the other).

I'm ashamed to admit when he was hired all I could think about was how
much I could do everything he was doing, probably because I was young
and *very* ambitious. Somehow I resented that Devin was doing what I loved
so much as a career and I sincerely believed I could do it as well,
after all, I was the first person in the entire Humanities college to
learn HTML because I taught myself from the spec before anyone else even
knew about it, including those in the faculty. I remember being
confidant, but not particularly arrogant. But I'm sure I didn't come off
that way to some. Devin, like many or the staff who mentored me, would
always make time to talk about what they were doing. 

I still have random, amazing dreams of being back in college during
those days. It was absolute bliss to be free to explore *whatever* I
wanted while working in the Humanities lab. Part of me feels like my
place is still on a college campus, but there is just so much broken
about *any* higher educational institution for me to ever be a part of
academy as it stands today.

I wish there were institutions with the leadership and vision to start
from scratch approaching learning in an entirely new way while
hearkening back to the truest form of education: mentorship. Everything
significant I learned in college from mentors like Devin. The rest of my
experience was learning *in spite* of the "banker-style" approach from
everyone else to deposit what they wanted into our brains.

I can at least dream of how it might have been if *every* learning
relationship I had in college was with peers and faculty who approached
learning in true Frerian "dialogical" form. They give lip service to the
traditions established by Socrates. They don't mean it. At the end of
the day, today's universities just want your money, that's why they dump
most of their budget into good football teams and schmooze-fests for
alumni. The stench of putrid pork fills their "hallowed" halls.
