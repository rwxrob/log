Been wondering about the `yml` v.s. `yaml` again and after reading that
the overwhelming majority of Internet searches result in the preference
for `yml` as well as the Kubernetes popularity of the shorter extension
I've decided to keep the shorter one for my `cv` standard. One thing
that came to mind was the pronunciation of it. I've always hated
sounding out things instead of citing the letters in the suffix. By
going with the shorter version citing the letters is easier.
