Quora is shit. Why on Earth would a site dedicated to questions and
answers not even load without JavaScript enabled. How fucking *stupid*
can you get? Fucking morons over there at Quora. Be warned, don't work
for that shit-stain of a company.

I've concluded Paulo Friere's [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Pedagogy of the Oppressed), which I
learned recently was banned in Arizona in 2012 by the powers that be
because it encourages people to question and think for themselves. The
final words of the Afterword really hit home with me:

> Friere's theory and practice proposed all education as politics. No
pedagogy can be neutral because all develop human subjects and produce
consciousness one way or another, depending on the ideology of the
contents, the social relations of discourse, and the learning process of
the curriculum. Any pedagogy of curriculum which does not question the
status quo tacitly or actively endorses it.

This reminds me of my rant against Rust's claim that "all technology is
political" but I can't help draw a distinction between one specific
technology as a tool and education. In fact, I'd suggest that the people
behind that assumption are conflating the two even if they mean well. A
gun isn't political. The culture --- and education that led to that
culture --- are.

The afterword concludes:

> For Paulo, throughout his life and work, the essential questions of
> this famous book remained:
>
> * What kind of world to we live in?
> * Why is it like that?
> * What kind of world do we want?
> * How do we get there from here?

All kind of bells and whistles went off in my head and heart when I read
those words.

These questions *must* be answered before anyone can pursue a
meaningful education of any kind. The lesser questions are automatically
answered in the follow-ups:

* "Should I learn to code?"
* "Which programming language is best?"
* "Should I go to college?"
* "What should I do?"

Over the past eight years I have seen hundreds of people struggle
with the wrong questions. They *think* they want to learn to code or
hack, but they haven't figured out why. Many claim they are learning it
to "get a job" but it runs deeper than that. Why does anyone get a job?
"To eat," of course, I can hear people say. But people throughout history
and geography have foregone eating when it mattered for what drives
them. You always have to eat, sure, but once you have nourishment
you crave more when you are still hungry for the pursuit of a world
you want to live in, even if your confused goal is lavish,
wasteful extravagance. 

So I would delineate the following for number 4 in Friere's questions:

1. Which skills, knowledge, and abilities will take us there?
1. Which should I learn?
1. How can I learn them?
1. When and where do I start?

SKILSTAK and my live streaming *are* that start, from my point of view,
for the most important tech skills, knowledge, and abilities to lead us
to the world I would like to see, but there are many more which are very
much not technical that are equally important. My recent personality
test (for fun) got me to thinking about that. In fact, it got me to
reassessing my career path entirely.

Yes I've had a successful career as a technologist. But my work history
is filled with the successful application of other skills that are *not*
technical --- most importantly community organization, evangelism, and
communication.

This leaves me asking myself a very important question that will shape
the rest of my life:

*Should I pursue a non-technical career at this point in my life?*

The question makes me shudder.

I am haunted by the humble group of evaluators from among my peers
during my initial on-boarding at IBM during an exercise where we were
forced to take on the opposite of our current comfort role. They
lavished me with praise as a team leader and kept saying that I should
*really* look into it. I never forgot it. Another time my favorite
manager said, "It feels like you are coasting" and I never figured out
what he meant. I still don't.

I enjoyed my career at IBM, but I most enjoyed when I became a default
leader and community organizer even when it wasn't in the job
description.

Aargh. Life is hard.

I feel like some people will be reading this and be like, "old, white,
dude problems, \*pffff\*". 

I hate that I've had it easier than others. In fact, that is the *one*
thing I want to work on with the rest of my life, which is why *under no
circumstances* will I ever stop live streaming educational content ever
again. It is the single most significant way I can address the
injustices in this world, for those who are willing and able to pick up
these skills and change their own stars. I just have to do it better,
which is why I think I might be most interested in a career that pays me
to do it. Now it's time to find one that does.

Wife passed on this [great
article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sanjay-gupta-prescription-for-fighting-off-dementia-keep-sharp/)
about keeping our brains sharp and develop our "cognitive reserves." It
boils down to the following things (all of which I'm happy to say I'm
doing regularly):

1. Exercise --- "good for the heart, good for the brain", signals "I wanna
   be here", "sitting is the new smoking"

1. Diet --- "berries ... one of your best foods" for the brain 

1. Learning --- "change builds resiliency", "scares you", "not crosswords"

1. Sleep --- nightly "rinse cycle" 

1. Social --- "*critically* important", "walk with a friend",
   "neurochemicals released ... when touch ... look into someone's eyes"

1. Empathy, Kindness, Compassion --- "*ultimate* sort of nourishment for
   the brain"

I really love that last one. It proves scientifically that mean people
are objectively more likely to be brain-dead stupid and paranoid, which
2020 pretty much proves. At a personal level, I can attest that after a
mean rant I feel like I have lost brain capacity, not gained it ---
especially when compared to moments when I lavish praise on something I
love or laugh hysterically. Dopamine is clearly better for the brain
than Cortisol. I imagine that is how Robin lived so very long past the
limitations of any other mortal with a brain as diseased as his had become.
