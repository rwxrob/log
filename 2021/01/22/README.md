Just watching some Twitch coding streamers and I gotta say I have
nothing positive to say. I'm trying really hard to not go negative. I
just cannot believe what people actually think is important to work on.
There's nothing wrong with recreation, but when that becomes the entire
focus of everything you do it's time to re-examine your life's choices.
It's probably just my age showing, as usual.

Discovered that for power `gh` (GitHub CLI) users it makes a lot more
sense to use `gh auth login --with-token < <(auth token github)` after
having added a <https://github.com/settings/tokens> will full access.

TimG reports More reason to never use Java if you have a choice:

> Speaking of arrays. I finally found a Java limitation that I needed to make a
workaround for. Java array initializers are limited to 65k elements. Java
classes are limited to 65k worth of initializer cumulative. I ended up
needing to write automation to split arrays into chucks and put each chunk in a
subclass with functions to combine everything.  Java is an old language, why
have something so limiting? I can't be the first to run into such a thing???  

That is for JDK 12.0.1.

People who name their repose dumb shit like "Twitch-IRC-Bot" should be
roundly chastened for their lack of good decision making.

Looking back at all the initiatives I've attempted over the years I
can't help feeling something different about AFK Workers and especially
KEG. This time I have the backing of a bunch of brilliant "basement
dwellers" and other outliers with the collective experience and insight
I've not been exposed to before.

If nothing more, I don't feel as lonely as before. I have frequently
fought with an internal sense of frustration at having solutions to
things that I just cannot get off the ground, but that is much less
today. People *do* care about the same things that I do. They just are
not tweeting, making videos, and writing ivory tower academic papers
about it that no one will see without paying for them.

Perhaps the simplest way to put this is, I found other people who
actually like to read, who are informed, who care about the world we are
in, and are passionate about seeking solutions despite the overwhelming
odds against us all.

Great initial meeting of The Association of Federated Knowledge Workers.
We had a blast and came up with a bunch of fun names, the most important
of which is KEG, or Knowledge Exchange Grid, which plays out nicely in
many ways:

* KEG Knowledge Base
* KEG Node
* "KEGers" (meetups for knowledge exchange)
* "tapping the KEG for answers"

For more fun stuff <https://github.com/afkworks> has the repos.

I went ahead and secured `keg.network` and `keg.sh` for the group.

Also, I didn't even look if something else is already using the name.
Frankly, I don't give a shit. I'm using it no matter what. It's just too
fucking good not to use.
