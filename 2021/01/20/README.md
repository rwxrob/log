Finished simplified <https://rwxrob.live> using just a single file with
CSS grid and Google fonts. 

Someone said that Google fonts are going away. And I did confirm that
Google is blocked in China so there is good reason to *never* use CDN
fonts. I still need to fix that.

Got my little `log` script working that prepends a new entry on the
current log for the current day but that also adds to any other log
entry when adjusted using the `date -d` adjusters.

Really enjoying watching the news on C-SPAN and having a conversation
with people on the live stream. It's amazing how many actually *get* my
really obscure references that practical fall out of my mouth without
thinking, oh yeah, and listening to the people calling in to C-SPAN
(and, yes, making fun of them, a little).
