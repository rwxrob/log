Canonical has an insane interview process of stages:

1. Initial screening (done)
1. Personal essay (this stage)
1. Meet and Greet with and engineer interview
1. Standardised aptitude and personality tests
1. General interviews 
1. Recruitment screen 
1. Technical assessment
1. Role-specific interviews
1. Hiring manager interview
1. Executive interview

Just more proof of why you should *never* consider working for such a
dumb ass company.

Remembering the foundational value of screenshots during *everything*
--- especially during conf calls with video and desktop sharing that
contain information you are never going to see again. Running an entire
video recording might be overkill, but being able to take a quick
screenshot and save immediately is *essential*.
