I need some terms for the different scale of learning activities and
content:

***exercise*** - a small task (micro project) that can be timed designed
to be repeated until mastered (this is similar to "katas" just not as
fucking boring)

***challenge*** - a specific task (project) with requirements,
status/state, and a measurable result

***quest*** - a number of challenges that when combined result in a
larger accomplishment
