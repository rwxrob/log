Realized today that I really need to go back to 24 hour streaming and
holding onto the main transcoding. That way I don't need to suck-up to
become a Twitch partner just to get what YouTube provides automatically
to people.

Besides, that's how I started, as a place for reliable music and good
code and quotes and stuff. By going all day, every day, it creates a
room for people.

I also thought that I could create another account for being on the road
walking around and stuff. I could keep the cyclesadhu for that.
