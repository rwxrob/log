Heard a funny/unfortunate story about a RedTeam with a member who
"Control-D-ed" out of a terminal after 20 minutes of work, yet another
tale of how bad learning `nano` is if you don't get off of it. The
thought of a "hacker" learning it (and only it) is hilarious.

Reminded that JSON floats are unmarshalled as `float64` in Go, not less.
Makes me wonder what happens on a system that only supports 32.
