Here's how to learn Go (despite the utter lack of *good* beginner
documentation). It's important that you understand you need to research
how to do each of these as you go and that there is one one best
resource for how to do them. In other words, learn how to do
just-in-time learning for each project and task:

* Do all the challenges in Go: <https://rwx.gg/lang/cha>
* Code a simple terminal application
* Code a text adventure (bonus for random events)
* Code a Discord bot
* Code a rudimentary web server (with `net/http`)
* Write a robust web server (with `context`)
* Write a web crawler (learn good concurrency)
* Now do all that again from scratch (repetition is mother of learning)

Another thing is (at least in the early stages) to get a mentor or peer
group to review your solutions. If you can't find one, join us on
RWX.gg or find a really good developer that you trust and read their
code a lot, then ask yourself "What would ... do?"
