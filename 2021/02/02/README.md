as long as I have the ability to select what is private and what is not.
It's about the control.

As a professional mentor I feel like I have three main jobs:

1. Get you to learn (motivation)
2. Get you to become an autodidact
3. Show you what there is out there to learn

Just learned about the `use standard;` pragma that seems to combine the
normal `use warnings; use strict;` stuff from previous eras.

Also learned that Perl 7 will be Perl 5 but with all the standard
defaults.
