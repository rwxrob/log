It appears that I have been burned by the 1.15 to 1.16 change in Go
requiring that everything have a `go.mod` (where it was somewhat
optional before, by default).

I cannot say how great the idea is to do a resume at different stages of
complexity in order to convey in a relevant way all the advantages (and
dangers) of the different approaches while keeping the content
project-based and succinct.

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript  (just enough to customize, non-archivable)
1. YAML file plus Jekyll (uses stuff already on GitHub)
1. YAML file plus Golang templates (fucking amazing templates)
