Summarized the *command with actions* description as post-modern take on
traditional UNIX philosophy. 

Noting that actions should be 1-5 characters tops, with 3 or less being
the target when possible.

Command shields extremely brief action names from naming conflicts with
the shell.

Commands should always be three character or less.

Just remembering that I need to categorized my TODOs a bit so that the
semi-trivial stuff I can work on between monitored mentoring challenges
(so long as they do not require a lot of immersive thought).

The harder TODOs that require a good flow state are the things I should
play for during the day or on the weekends when I can really focus even
with a live stream audience.

Fuck monetization (or at least any money from it). 

I've always said I wasn't doing this directly for the money. Success, as
I define it, is new connections and networking (which usually results in
financial gain as well, but not necessarily).

Yesterday I managed a 16 hour stream just from leaving it on. The chance
of any stream of that length surviving demonetized are extremely low.
So, might as well embrace it and work around it.

The good news is that I need not fear doing short samples of videos nor
should I fear background music (on occasion). In fact, the sooner I get
my own RTMP stream the less I ever have to worry. Besides, people are
Twitch partners with 10s of thousands of followers who blatantly DJ and
mix copyrighted content all the time.
