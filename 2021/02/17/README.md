Given the following discoveries over the last month I wonder if there
might be a better strategy for casting the widest possible community
recruitment net. It's not about the money. It's about getting the
services to push your content the most.

* Twitch and YouTube won't promote you unless you play their game
* YouTube promotes equally for non-live content (currently)
* Twitch requires affiliate (or even partner) to be promoted
* Twitch requires less promotion than YouTube
* YouTube live chat kills chapter bookmark sidebar

What I really need to find out:

* How many people recently have found me *specifically* because of
  YouTube live streams?
* How many people rely on YouTube live streams?
* How many rely on Twitch live streams? 
* Where are the most people that I want to reach?

There are two main reasons I went with YouTube dual stream (and dropped
Twitch affiliate):

* Transcoding available for all
* Real time chapters
* Additional discoverability
* Ad revenue (but not a big consideration)

I feel like a lot of high-quality have found me this last month through
YouTube who would never even install Twitch without having discovered me
there. It seems like being live is that extra thing that allows people
to know they can immediately interact with you, even if YouTube live
chat is disabled.

Combining source code and user documentation (that is not about how to
use the API) has always been a dubious decision. But, I realize even
more now that forcing people to follow a KEG root node --- even if the
content is relevant with the source code in the same Git repo --- will
most likely get you added to people's ignored lists.

I'm realizing that a fundamental design decision when deciding how to
organize your KEG content is simply ask the question. "Would I want to
download a zip of all of this?" Normally, you will realize that a bunch
of stuff doesn't belong, including source code that isn't part of the
knowledge itself (or it's generators).
