Finished test of using symlinks with Git submodules as a registry method
for `cmdtab` subcommands. This means we can piggy-back on GitHub as our
global registry for subcommands.

In other words, if any subcommand is likely to be reused in anything it
gets created as its own repo following the `cmdtab` command convention.

The whole `date -d` thing makes me want to use the composable-commands
approach and create something in `cmdtab` that lets the subcommands be
inherited.
