Had a realization about what I can do with the `skilstak.io` domain.
I've always wanted it to be an interactive, treasure-hunt, cyber-escape,
learning game with a plot, something that is just all Easter eggs tied
together one to another. Plus this is consistent with the T-shirts that
I had created that still have the first clue on them.

So here's where the games and content will be (in the order that I
hope to finish them):

`rwx.gg` - Research, Write, Explore and Experiment Labs
`boost.rwx.gg` - Beginner Boost
`sh.boost.rwx.gg` - POSIX Shell (`dash`,`ash`) Beginner Boost
`c.boost.rwx.gg` - C Beginner Boost
`py.boost.rwx.gg` - Python Beginner Boost
`go.boost.rwx.gg` - POSIX shell (`dash`,`ash`) beginner boost

And then later:

`bash.boost.rwx.gg` - Bash
`keg.sh` - browse the knowledge net from `curl` (or whatever)
`skilstak.io` - "learn code, save the world" learning game
