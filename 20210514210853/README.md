Changing my default stream font to 36 which is 80-ish columns wide (just
like the old days). I got the idea after seeing the presentations from
the MIT courses and remembering this was what I used to use on the 60"
big screen at SKILSTAK back in the day. Some might complain, but meh.
I mean why stream without focusing on the person reading it instead of
myself. Hell I can even read this in the tiny OBS preview window.
