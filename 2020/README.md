The year that modern America came apart at the seems (while Trump's fake
hair remained largely unscathed). Thankfully, I was already moving
toward smaller private mentoring and at the recommendation of my
son-in-law and others started live streaming on Twitch, which led to me
being more than prepared for the pandemic shutdown that followed, even
if our asshole land-lord --- who promised to support us staying in our
rental home for years --- decided to "liquidate the asset" which our
home and my place of business. So we scrambled into an apartment to wait
out the storm and prepare to move into our home so we never have to deal
with shitty, evil landlords again.
