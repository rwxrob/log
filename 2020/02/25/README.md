This is been an uttering exhausting week. I barely recovered from the
month of streaming on Twitch and all that goes into setting that up and
then doing it regularly. It is every bit as time consuming as most
people would guess.

The bright side is that it has forced me to be even more organized in my
work and to follow a strict schedule, which has been proven over and
over again to improve productivity no matter what the endeavor. Here is
the current one for reference later (when I will be like, "Woah, he was
crazy back then.")

Found confirmation that `let`, `const` and fat-arrow functions in modern
JavaScript are *not* hoisted (thank God).
