Boy do I feel stupid. Starting writing a `figlet` command to convert
text to figlet ASCII art and discovered an entire ecosystem and command
already exist for it, including the `.ftf` font file format.

Best way to capture the news since yesterday is to make a tweet about
every item to cover in the news. That way people see the Twitter stream,
have the links, and I have something to refer to when doing Coffee Talk
about it.

I had experimented with storing up email and bookmarks but neither are
very efficient and can't be easily shared with the end user watching the
stream. For Twitter stuff someone just has to follow to get it. Hell,
they don't even have to watch the video, but if they do they will get
more details about the tweets.

In short, tweet and then cover the tweets daily in live summary
explaining them and putting them into context.

Made a fun personal status tool that just changes the current ASCII
letter status and also updates the `~/.now` text file to pull into the
schedule scene in OBS. It detects being AFK and sets "away" status. Bash
is fun.
