I'm just testing some of my old videos compared to some polished talk
videos on YouTube and I have realized I have to redo them all because
the sound levels are too low (and annoying).

Found a *really* great audio thing in OBS Studio. Under *Edit* ->
*Advanced Audio Properties* you can change the top decibel level. This
allows you to keep your voice in the yellow and all other sound in the
green (as suggested by OBS) and then to boost the output as needed if
you are coming across to soft in your final videos. For me adding 20db
is perfect.

And here's what it looks like:

To test it I recorded started an OBS recording while a YouTube video is
playing. Then I played it back and checked that the volume playback
level is the same as when I'm listening to it normally. I tried 10db at
first and this wasn't enough. Then I bumped it to 20db. I think another
2db would be ideal, but going to just keep it at 20db.

This explains the reason when I first started that people thought my
sound levels were low. They were in the final product.

I'm also really happy that I managed to get around the limitations of
this \$60 Xenyx Q802USB board. All I needed to do was plug the left and
right Phone/CtrlRM jacks into one of my inputs and rig up the headphones
to monitor the output, which I really wanted to do anyway because I want
an identical monitor of what is going into the computer, not just the
mic channel.
