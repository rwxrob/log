Stuff is coming in so fast even blogging it isn't fast enough, so
Twitter stream it is. I'm handling stuff every day in Coffee Talk so
that covers it. Stuff that needs to be searched will land here
eventually.

I imagine these are the challenges a talk show host must face every day,
being able to keep up on the news and events, process and curate that
information, and then create a monologue (something to say about it).
It's exhausting all by itself. Keeping up is nearly impossible.
