I've noticed that being subscribed to a mailing list and being required
to deleted each email as it comes in actually has value because I gives
an immediate and ongoing sense of how much the topic is being discussed,
how hot it is, for lack of a better word. I've noticed that when the
volume of a certain list goes down, say the Sites in Search Working
Group, that it indirectly indicates if there's a problem. When there's a
spike in email from one of these lists, it is a good idea to have a look
at what's going on, because it's probably significant and probably
hasn't social media. In fact, many of these topics *never* hit social
media at all but are *critical* to understand.

This morning was the first morning that I actually got to review Twitter
as usually do. It's important that I make time for this because of all
they critical data that comes through it. People discount Twitter all
the time, but it has an invaluable resource of news and critical current
information about tech in general and tech as it relates to my specific
interests. It's a hard sale to prove to most people. They think Twitter
and they think Kardashians and trolls.
