Looks like all the reasons to have any presence (code) on GitHub have
dissolved. In fact, there are very few things that GitHub has that
GitLab does not:

* A *lot* of members.
* Sponsorship.
* Easier (albeit ancient) web hosting.
* Stronger likelihood of being "discovered".

No seriously, that is it. And honestly those reasons don't hold water
any more.
