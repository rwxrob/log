Two types of learning from others one-on-one (or a small group):

* Beginners teaching others what they just learned.
* Knights and serfs (currently employed professionals).
* Veterans mentoring what they did their whole life.

Teacher's become facilitators making and managing the connections.

[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is an amazing Android-compatible,
drop-in replacement for the OS on your Google Pixel that has had *all*
of Google's spying removed. I think I'm finally ready to go back to a
smart phone now that I know it exists. This is the middle path between
using the vendor's stuff and the insane Librem5. It means I don't have
to throw out my Pixel hardware and can actually make good use of it.
Just have to have a good SIM card.

Really loving the Raspi 4. It can run a full multi-user Minecraft server
without a hiccup (3 could not even overclocked) and it has full gigabit
speeds meaning with a USB 3 Ethernet adapter you can make an amazing
packet sniffer and put it on your home network to learn all sorts of
cool stuff about how networking works (not to mention sniff any
unencrypted password your mom, dad, or sibling enters without HTTPS).
Who doesn't want to do that? ;) The fact that it is hardware means that
it can't be detected on the network like an Alpha in monitor mode could
be, but also means people would not regularly be looking at the physical
location of your home Internet connection (but most don't).

Also hearing about the [Arduino Portenta
H7](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-h7).

> "Run Tensorflow for low power machine learning."

The ads for this thing are all pros using it in IoT settings with
construction hats on, dual core processor at 480 MHz, hi-density
connectors for infinite GPIO extensions. The thing is serious. Nothing
says ARM == IoT more than a device like this.

Why do I care? 

Because IoT *is* ARM. As much as I love Gooligum and MicroChip PICs for
learning Assembly (because they are so simple) the true future of IoT is
learning to code for devices such as the Arduino Potenta H7. Knowing
they exist is the first solid indicator that *this* is where the
industry is going. The complex PICs that MicroChip keeps putting out are
not going to stand a chance against the power of low-power ARM chips for
this stuff, even with MicroChip's massive monopoly on the PIC market.

The movement of light TensorFlow crunched models to the endpoints is
taking off like crazy as well, which means *machine learning* is key
(not necessarily all "Data Science", a horrible term and machine
learning people hate as bad as "Full Stack").

Just hearing about a device called the [Sierra AirLink
FX30](https://source.sierrawireless.com/devices/fx-series/fx30/), a
\$200 minimal 3G/4G LTE cellular gateway. I smell pineapple, mmmmm! Here
are some fun facts about it that confirm some of my main unpopular
conclusions:

* No `nano`, just `vi`, not even `vim`.
* Just `/bin/sh` which looks like probably `ksh`. 

In other words, if you are into IoT you really need to pretend you have
one of these *and only one of these* when you make your decisions about
workflow, habits, and muscle-memory.

Quickly mentioning the need I have had to start quizzing people
immediately on their reading for the week to keep them doing it. I try
to avoid any kind of quiz or test, but it is really the only thing that
gets them doing it and helps me know if they even tried. If not, no
worries, do it again next week.

That means I need a way to quickly capture quiz questions for a given
section of a given book, which works out because I'm already annotating
the book so having some self-test quiz questions along with exercises is
the obvious goal.

Here are some for example:

Introduction:
* Why should you use the command line?
* What is the book about?
* What does it mean to "live" on the command line?
* What are other ways besides command line to use computer?
* What is Linux? What does Linux-centric mean? Why is Linux different?
* What does Watts mean by "freedom"?
* What is an SBC? Name one example.
* What does CLI stand for?
* What does HCI stand for?
* What does REPL stand for?
* What does GUI stand for?
* What does TUI stand for?
* What is a CUI?
* How is a TUI different than a CLI?
* What HCIs were used *before* terminals existed?
* What HCIs might come in the future?
* Which HCI is the most efficient (so far)?
* What skills are required to use a CLI?
* What type of interface is used for a MUD?
* Who might prefer a MUD over a graphic game?
* Who might prefer a graphics only game?
* Why is it important that we thing about *all* users?
* What does *accessibility* mean?
* What makes "knowledge of the command line" different than "many
computer skills"?
* Which version of the shell should you learn?

Part I
* What is a shell? What do you do with it? What's its purpose?
* How do you start and use it?
* What is the name of the shell that is default on Linux?

Being reminded that working with some people requires they know
*exactly* what they are going to get and generally how fast it will
take. Unfortunately this is impossible to state exactly for any one
person. The best I can do is provide the "fruit" of their learning and
direct them up the tree at each branching node toward the specific fruit
they want. Here's a rough summary of the most in-demand fruit here (in
order of popularity):

1. A Minecraft server
1. A Game.
1. A tech job.
1. A Web page.
1. Hacker skills.
1. An App.

I'm feeling the need to return to a friendlier diagram of the path to
get to these specifically, something with a bit more color. The question
is whether to make them all on one chart (as I maintained for years) or
on separate charts and just how informal and fun to make it. To date
everything has been black-and-white and very formal. I'm not a fan of
kitschy forced graphic art and infographics, but maybe it's time. Maybe
I could hire the artists I know to pretty-ify it.

This week I need to have everyone declare their path (again) and I need
to completely delete all my writing about "first stack, full stack"
because honestly, in practice it doesn't work. I've now has a year to
full test that approach and I can say pretty clearly it fails. It tries
to maintain too many skills concurrently.

Instead, the focus not is *chopping* everything that is not critical to
the specific path and seriously isolating the core skills that
*everyone* needs. That means *terminal mastery for everyone* like before
with skilstak.sh fully restored. It means allowing some to drop if they
are not interested in learning the very most important skills to learn
as I see them, which, more harshly stated means, "Learn terminal skills
or get out."

This is *especially* true now that I have to turn away potential people
I could take on one-on-one to teach from the stream over those who might
complain here locally. Streaming has been a really fortunate discovery
for this very reason.

Finally found how to silence the volume up and down sound. It's under
Sounds tab of the Sound system preference window. I turned everything
off since I'm streaming it all at any given point during the day. Just
taking a note so I don't forget.

God I get triggered by people who put their religious affiliation as the
first thing in their title like this:

> "Christian. Hacker. Pirate. Ninja. Author. KC3FRD. Hackers for
> Charity."

No one gives a shit. If you feel some guilt to your God and creator to
make sure HE gets top billing so be it, but don't force all of us to
read it. Sure it's your feed. You are free to do what you want,
including being an asshole.

Ironically the people who do this are *almost* always Christians. You
don't see Quakers, Buddhists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims, Jews doing
this (okay some Muslims do put something praising Allah into everything
I suppose). The point is *don't.* Anyone who actually gave a shit and
treated what you have to say differently because of your *professed*
belief in a particular religion (instead of proving your piety with you
actual actions) is severely stuck in the worst kind of echo chamber.

Think of it, "Hummm, this person is Christian, so I better listen to
them *even more* than the others. Oooo, he's wearing a cowboy hat, he's
my kind of people. I'm so glad I found him!"

Sadly that is *exactly* what they think. No wonder we are in serious
trouble. The only thing worse is listening to a Fox News anchor more
intently because she's just so damn hot! Just ask Meghan Kelly who had
to "twirl" in front of Jabba the Fox Blob just to get the job despite
her Ivy league college law degrees.

By the way, this is a great example of when the one true mantra and
commandment can be applied:

> "What if everybody did it?"

Asking that question immediately reveals how stupid it is. What if every
single person on Twitter listed their religious affiliation at the first
thing in their description? How about the Christians who do not? Are
they *less* Christian because they didn't? Is the reason you feel it
should be the first fucking thing we read about you serious enough that
you silently judge the rest of the world for *not* listing that they are
a Christian very first? It's like a really bad Black Mirror episode
where all those who *don't* profession their Christianity every time
they fill out a profile are condemned for being too apathetic. 

It would be funny if it were not *exactly* what the Nazis did under
Hitler. Not wearing enough Swastikas? Hummm, you are suddenly watching
the people following you around ever corner.

I know this seems like just a little thing. "Dude, why are you freaking
out?" Because it is little things like this that trigger me because of
the underlying dangerous psychology that promotes doing that shit. Some
place deep down this asshole judges everyone who *doesn't* list their
religious affiliation first, but judges them even more if when they do
so they are another one.

And no, it's not like listing the proper pronoun to be used. As annoying
as that is listing he/him is practical because (as I've encountered on
stream) you simply don't know what pronoun to use for a random person on
Twitter or Twitch.

Sigh.

I got an email (again) today about the fight against the Alaska pipeline
and it always makes me wish I had unlimited time. I like to think I'm
putting a lot of good out into the world and I'm making the best use of
my time here but I always feel like I should be doing more.

I didn't always feel that way. At one point I felt that if I was doing
my Mormon church "calling" and taking care of my family (the way my wife
at the time thought was acceptable) that I was good, that my
contribution to humanity had been fulfilled. How wrong I was.

People who get in their little insulated bubbles of religion or
community and never look outside at what's going on around them are
almost a physical manifestation of Plato's cave. I never *ever* want to
find myself there again. Why the fuck do I have to be 52 to really
realize this? (To be fair to myself I knew it all along and only acted
on it in my late 40s.) No wonder old people are always looking tired.
They have less energy and more awareness, which is a frustrating
combination to be sure.
