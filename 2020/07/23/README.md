I'm having a *really* hard time with the overwhelming level of laziness
in the mainstream population --- particularly among the highly gifted
who could be doing *so* much more for the world. Don't know why it's
hitting me so hard today. People constantly complain about now having
enough time for this or that when in fact that have *gobs* of time that
they are *choosing* to waste on absolutely stupid shit. At least I will
be able to eventually die with a clean conscious that I worked my
fucking ass off to make the world --- and everyone's lives in it ---
just a little bit better.
