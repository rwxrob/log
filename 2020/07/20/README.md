As I wrap up the [`PEGn.pegn`
spec](https://gitlab.com/rwx.gg/pegn/spec/-/blob/master/PEGn.pegn) I
realized how much incredible value this has for helping people learn
different language syntaxes. The power comes from a drop-dead simple
representation of a language syntax that most people can understand
simply by looking at it with no further explanation. By having people
learn language syntax by studying a PEGn grammar they can immediately
apply their own internal syntax checkers when writing one.

This doesn't even touch how easy it is to excite someone into writing
their own language once they see how easy PEG grammars are to write. The
processing of logic in PEG makes for good logical ("computational")
thinking as well.

One of my new goals for the community is to have people write PEGn
grammars for all the major languages. Having a database of PEGn files
for all languages is *such* a huge win in terms of understanding
different languages and being able to create your own.
