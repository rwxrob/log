Yet another reason not to use Zsh(it). It doesn't even have [variable
name references](https://rwx.gg/advice/dont/zsh/). Zsh is such a script
kiddy toy, just so much evidence of that now. I'm beyond trying to
listen people convince me otherwise. "Run along. I have work to do."

Finally got at least all the main pages on [rwx.gg](https://rwx.gg)
working again and put the old `kn` shell script back in play. It is so
great for auditing.

Playing around with a new morning routine. Been up since 6am today,
yesterday 5:30. I have been naturally waking up earlier as I just write
off the end of the day and go to bed around 10:30. They say you need
less sleep as you age, but I don't buy into that idea --- especially if
you are still regularly exercising. I've been running for an hour or
more every day now for over a month. It's been absolute bliss. I love
yoga, but running on a good trail has always centered me mentally as
much or more. I'm still planning on daily strenuous yoga asana again
after I get my base health back.

Here's my daily schedule lately:

My best brain power of the day is --- without a doubt --- in the
morning. It is also when it is the most peaceful around here.

I'm going to do a better job writing this personal stuff down in case it
might help other people heading into old age watching their bodies freak
out in ways they could not have anticipated. Mine happens to be chronic
inflammation for reasons I cannot explain. Here's how I've started to
beat it:

1. Slow-paced running about an hour a day away from people
1. Completely eliminating any refined sugar or processed food
1. Dropping meat and carb-dense food from diet
1. Eating rather small portions of things more often
1. Setting an alarm to eat every three hours or so
1. Focusing on positive things instead of stressful stuff
1. Wearing a mask even in the house during pollen season
1. Taking my Xyzol to keep from reacting to our dog

I don't have Diabetes but my family is a long history of type I and II
so I figure treating myself as if I could have it eventually is just
safe. So far my blood sugar insulin response seems like I could be
subject to it a bit. 

I just read on a site run by the Diabetes association that one way to
treat it is to essentially track your food (and your blood glucose,
which I'm not doing to do yet at this point) and eat about 1800 calories
tops (for an average size person) with no high-carbs. It's kind of like
the Keto diet without the huge negative side-effects of Ketosis,
replacing fruit with veggies, fluids, and fat --- glorious, good fats.

In fact, fat is really the secret to a lot of good health (for me). It
is so fucking ironic that one misunderstood study sent the entire world
into an obesity and Diabetes epidemic mostly because everyone eliminated
all fat from their diet.

Fat provides consistent energy and blood sugar without spiking. It
satisfies you so you eat less. Some fats are essential to building brain
cells.

One thing is for sure. Sugar is the *fucking* devil. It feeds Cancer. It
spikes insulin and destroys the Pancreas. It rots your teeth.
Statistically speaking Sugar is more deadly than Cocaine and yet they
are basically the same thing, addictive isolates taken from natural
sources.

I've been cleaning up the sites with the old Bash `kn` script now that
I'm taking all this luxurious time to actually finish Ezmark. It is
always good to use the prototype again to get a sense of what I was
trying to do in the first place. Keeps me grounded.

One thing that looks ludicrous to me now is adding so much data to the
YAML metadata header. Back then I was convinced it was easier to use the
YAML since it is more structured. But the truth is the YAML should
*always* be about the *meta*. Content specifications can call for
certain header names and structure to the Markdown (whatever flavor).
Anything else probably deserves its own file that can be rendered
inline, which is what the RenderMark approach is all about.
