Looking over plans for the rest of the year and comparing my offerings
with those of others and it is clear I need to make a few changes.
Here's the summary after talking it over with Doris:

1. Complete and organize opensource projects (PEGN, Ezmark, `kn`,
RWX.GG, README.World) enough for allow others to contribute and put into
their own portfolios. Recruit help.

1. Simultaneously continue working on porting the original Python
SkilStak challenge set to language-agnostic challenges.

1. Identify language-specific challenges and organize them as well.
Create a challenge summary page for each language that embeds the
language-agnostic ones.

1. Create *Polyglot Programming* Twitch/YouTube video walkthroughs of
the challenges done in simultaneously in Bash, JavaScript, Python, and
Go.

1. Update the SkilStak curriculum to take into account the additions.

1. Formalize the SkilStak waiting list.

1. Raise SkilStak rates minimally after curriculum updates are in place
mostly due to limit of 25 community members maximum.
