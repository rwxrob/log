As I have been working on <https://rwx.gg> and adding more content to it
I realized it would be great if there was a setting where users could
simply click on the title to take them to an DuckDuckGo.com search. It
wasn't to hard to implement, but the question of whether to use the
*lite* version or not came up. In Lynx it looks beautiful, Chrome not so
much. I decided to write some JavaScript that upgrades the URL to the
non-lite version in Chrome. It only runs when a browser has full
JavaScript support. It then occurred to me that the foundational
principle of *progressive* web apps is that they *progressively* take
advantage of the capabilities of the browser technology available. Then
it occurred to me what a *massive* fail our modern Web is based on this
foundational principle. All this unnecessarily broken React shit is
going to implode, I swear to God. At least my personal observance of the
*progressive principle* is beyond even what most are considering in the
graphic web browser world. We live in a world of absolutely clueless
asshole developers who both do not care about this principle and
couldn't even implement it properly if they did. At least I can do
something about it myself (and help others not be for *fucking*
clueless).

Just had a panic attack because suddenly Discord decided to echo back
everyone's voice to the point where it was really distracting. Tomorrow
is Coffee Talk and I was stressing out. I think it has something to do
with the reboot the other day and possibly the fact that I had to change
the input back to the mixer board (auto-picked the camera mic).

Turns out all that had to be fixed was a "Reset Voice Settings" in
Discord.

Just talking casually with my wife about all this and got a rather nice
comment about my mentoring ability on the YouTube channel strongly
asking for more. My superpower is curating, communicating, and
mentoring, the rest is all secondary including the fact that I can code,
hack, and build systems. 

There is a character called Phillip in the *Travelers* show that I've
been watching who is like a walking historian and computer. The team
lead, McClairen, who is a self-proclaimed "languages guy" besides being
a natural communicator and leader. I find myself relating to both of
them a lot.

When I crack open the 1200 page text book "bible" of *Algorithms* all I
can think is, "why the fuck do I care?" Maybe that is why I switched
from Computer Science as my major after my first semester when I
discovered the humanities and language labs. Ironically the computer
technology in the languages lab was *far* superior to that in the
computer science lab. Why? Because it was *relevant* and being used. The
CS dweebs would laugh at the Macs there, but people were getting serious
shit done with them everyday, not debating the merits of C v.s. Pascal
as I would hear the lab attendants doing while suffering through CS101
bubble-sort Pascal programming and taking pencil-written tests for
coding. In fact, (I'm just gonna say it) I fucking *hate* infinitely
removed computer science shit. No one cares until it provides something
the world needs. Do we need people with that level of computer science
understanding? Hell yes! But what we need even more is people *using*
these amazing tools to produce software, information, and systems that
will push humanity forward. In fact, the amount of strictly trained CS
people the world needs is really not that great. But the world is
starving for people with practical knowledge who will push it forward. 

God knows there is enough work for thousands of people just to counter
the fucking idiocy of the JS-JS-JS crowd who would destroy the best
information sharing standards the world has ever known. The world needs
more people with common sense and the courage to speak truth to power
and idiocy and the skills to counter the horrible shit other morons are
making. That's my priority, not how to create the best possible linked
list.

I keep coming back to the conclusion that I just need to do one thing
*really* well (more than a bunch of things sort of good). That thing is
getting more people started earlier by training them to train themselves
and become tech autodidacts as soon as possible.

I imagine myself sort of at the starting line pushing as many people as
possible into tech fields with a *solid* foundation in Linux terminal
skills and coding. I can't run far with them all if I want to be there
to boost others.

The single most important thing I can do is get as many people as I can
started out right because no one else is doing it *at all*. The amount
of bad information and content on the Internet is staggering. If I do
nothing but fight against that for the rest of my life I'm sure I would
still be behind.

This simply means I have no time for data structures and algorithms at
anything but a *very* fundamental level, a level that remains of
practical use while providing a solid foundation for those wishing to
dive deeper at a formal university level.

I honestly cannot decide what is the best contribution I can make over
the next year so I'm reflecting on a few things:

* I'm a good communicator and apparently I motivate people. 
* I'm a decent programmer and system administrator, but not spectacular. 
* I'm a practical person. 
* I'm comparatively slow at everything, but thorough.
* I produce high-quality stuff, when I actually finish.
* I believe in simplicity.
* I feel like the fastest path productivity is paramount.
* I'm absolutely obsessed with the efficiencies of the terminal.
* I recognized a dire need for *good* content covering terminal and
system administrator *practical* knowledge, not what it takes to get
hired.
* I have no desire to learn data structures and algorithms because they
have no *practical* value when it comes to producing value most of the
time.
* I'm obsessed with Linux.
* I'm obsessed with shell scripting good-enough tools quickly.
* I'm obsessed with automation.
* I'm obsessed with revolutionizing education and credentialing.

I suppose considering the needs of the world is important as well to see
where they align:

* The world is imploding because its systems are broken.
* The world's systems are broken because people are not engaged.
* The world needs to be less distracted.
* The world needs more people producing real value and change.
* The world needs more protectors and engineers.
* The world is at war, a massive cyberwar that goes unseen.
