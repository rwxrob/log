"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time,
will that it should become a universal law." ##  Sunday, May 17, 2020,

<http://linuxclass.heinz.cmu.edu/> Just found this course from Carnegie
Melon University randomly since it is the second hit from the [The Linux
Command Line](https://rwx.gg/books/tlcl/) searchable title. Check out
the [first
lecture](http://linuxclass.heinz.cmu.edu/Linux-Syllabus-S20A4.odt). I
can't lie. I laughed my ass off, then I cried a little at the exorbitant
costs of these *remedial* Linux courses. I hope colleges get the
collective kick in the ass that they need by this whole COVID thing.
College priorities have *long* been other things besides the best
education of their students.
