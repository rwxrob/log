[49:50 Antiquity Loop (5 miles)]{.run}

All the long walks and runs over the last three months have really
helped out. I'm back to 10 minute/mile pace (6mph) in my flats. Wonder
what my PR would be in some good shoes that are broken in.


Felt *so* amazing today. We'll see how recovery goes, but I'm convinced
that study was right, the best combination for overall health is 3-4
runs like this one or faster combined with every other day of recovery
walking and minimal strength and yoga.
