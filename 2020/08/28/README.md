Oooo, the best WSL2 upgrade guide yet:

* <https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10>

I'm seeing people that I mentor be completely unable to run Virtual Box
on Windows presumably because they once used WSL and not their system is
in Hyper-V mode. After the *huge* deal it is to get *any* virtual
machine running on Windows once you have *ever* used WSL or WSL2 it is
pretty much mandatory to use WSL2 from that point on. WSL is
disastrously bad having fundamental bugs as stupid as the `sleep`
command being unsupported. Thank God for that WSL2 upgrade guide. We'll
see how it goes.
