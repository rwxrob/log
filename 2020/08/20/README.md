Once again I'm learning the shortcut usually is the wrong thing to pick.
This time it's WSL --- even WSL2. Let's face it. No one is going to use
either of these in production or even as a professional workstation
either as a software engineer or SRE / DevOps engineer. 

Suffice it to say, I've having everyone revert back to using a virtual
machine approach for all Linux work if they don't have a box to install
it on. The clear advantage is that they can actually take a backup of
their virtual machine and install it anywhere else they might want to
take it. It also means that they are learning *real* skills for testing
out different operating systems.

By the way, PopOS on Virtual Box is a breeze for every beginner I've
helped get started. Once they figure out how to wrangle the screen
resolutions to see everything it works out very nicely.
