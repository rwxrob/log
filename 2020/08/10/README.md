Going to have to raise the price of a block from \$800 to \$900 in
January. My new curriculum will be done by then, plus the economy has
changed a lot and the demand for online education has really increased.
It puts the cost for a session at \$56.25. Considering that a 30 minute
private piano lesson or voice session is \$30 I'm still *well* within
the affordable range --- for those who *value* strong technical skills.
