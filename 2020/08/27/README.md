Added the following to all invoices going out for the rest of this year.

>   Beginning Jan 1 2021 cost for all blocks will increase from \$800
    per block to \$900. Enrollment is now capped at 25 total members.
    Applications for the waiting list are always available for other
    preferred time slots for current members as well as other potential
    members. Member referral applications are weighted greater than
    others. Thank you for spreading the word all these years.
