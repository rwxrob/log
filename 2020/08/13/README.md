Today I ran/shuffled 17.4 miles in 5 hours and 20 minutes --- a 18
minute/mile pace --- but that's running 90 minutes and taking a 10
minute yoga break and then doing another one. My actual running pace
hovers around 15 min/mile. I didn't even feel nearly as uncomfortable as
on other shorter runs. I think the secret was actually the shuffle
keeping my blood flowing without hitting lactate thresholds, and of
course the yoga to do what yoga does.

The shuffle is *so* much easier on the feet when running in my barefoot
Merrill's with Vibram souls. Now that I know Cliff dominated with it I
care not that I look like an old guy who needs to use the bathroom. My
feet are so happy. Have I mentioned that my feet are getting fucking
buff! It's hilarious. They are actually quite a bit bigger.

As you can imagine, the rest of me is *quite* a bit slighter. My belly
is almost completely gone. It's a great feeling even though it has taken
more work to get back in shape than I have ever faced in my life. I
can't believe I *ever* stopped being Team Endorphin Rob. I've *always*
been an endurance athlete even during the more stressful of times.
*NEVER* again! Only scrawny, vegetarian "soy boy", Patagonia,
yoga/endurance dude for the rest of my days.

All this has had one overall significant affect. I am just so fucking
happy all the time --- no matter what hits us, like being kicked out of
our apartment after finally personally investing thousands into the
yard. Some how I know everything will turn out okay.
