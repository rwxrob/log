Wow the weeks are *flying* by. So glad I have the number of weeks in the
directory name for the blog week.

So with the Corona virus shutting all organized gatherings down, like
completely, this has been a good chance to test everything over Discord
sessions. So far Discord turns out to actually be *better* than in
person. Some people still feel more comfortable learning in person if
they they are objectively better learners over Discord. Talk about
conditioning. The school system has everyone thinking you *have* to be
at a place to learn. The hard reality is that all of these people are
being conditioned to *not* learn without the crutch that is the system.
It's actually hurting them.
