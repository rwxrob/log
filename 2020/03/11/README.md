Tonight I will be going back to two hours of OverTheWire.org since that
is the prime time most people in America are online. Then I'll just push
back waking up.

And in other news, Imma hack Lynx to not waste the bottom line. It's not
worth using one of the broken new text browsers instead. (Although I do
need to look at the latest `links` again to see where it's at.)

Just happened on a fun term "break-in room" instead of "escape room".
The latter is well known and popular. But what if we made the opposite
and used lock picking and hacking in the physical world? I bet it would
do well.

Can you use nothing but the magic wand `!!` in `vi` to replace these
with their outputs?. Can you tell what program to use?

```bash
for i in {1..10};do
  echo Item. $i;
done 
```

```
[print(f"Item {x}.") for x in range(1,11)] (234234 * 3423423) / 234
```

Can you guess the output of each?

Yeah, you probably don't need a plugin. Just use your shell. It's the
best `vi` extension ever made.

TIL that the lag from not restarting your stream every few hours or so
is insane. Might be from the quality of the watcher. Will have to test.
