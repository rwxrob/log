Rather conflicted at the moment about this interpreted language to pick
back up again. All of the following are supported by `weechat` *and* are
prevalent in the Metasploit database:

* Python
* Perl
* TCL
* Ruby
* Lua

They are all mandatory languages at some point to learn. The question
which do you choose when all are available.

I did find it interesting that there is no Node in any of them.

I think, as I concluded earlier, that I have to get over my "bad
breakup" (Brian Cantrill's term) with Python and just accept that it is
a required *secondary* language to maintain. Here's all the
justification for that:

* Massive user base and only getting larger.
* Machine learning (`numpy`, Tensorflow, etc).
* Python will always be the darling of scientists.
* Python is *in* everything already.
* Pentesting uses a lot of Python.
* Python Fabric has no substitute.
* Python data structures seriously dominate.
* Python C stubbing it best in class (for interpreted).

Have to look at `nim` as well. But as a general purpose language Python
is mandatory learning for the G0CT certification, there is no doubt of
that (as much as I might hate that to be true).

Discovered today that the pretty graph that shows the volumes of a sound
stream is called a VU meter. Turns out there is a *really* good one for
terminal, which means, of course, that I had to [get
it](https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer). God I love what is
possible with full color terminal support all over the place now.
