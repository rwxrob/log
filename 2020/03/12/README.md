Realized earlier today that I had not blocked any time on the schedule
for coding, only the other stuff. That can't be. So I divided up
Saturday night into two blocks for Go and Rust development and Sundays
just for Shell. The C and Assembly can come during the OSCP time. The
Python and Web can be during the G0CT time.

I've decide that the CTF games will only be OverTheWire.org until I
finish them all since that is where most beginners will start and I want
to be able to nudge them as needed at any time. So anytime new OTW
content comes out that will take priority. Otherwise HTB Pro will be
priority during the three OCSP focused days of the week.

So I have concluded that I *do* want to make specific times for the
following specific topics:

1. RWX Cafe (Random Tech Talk)
1. G0CT Study Group
1. OSCP Study Group 
1. Mentors Guild
1. Hacker CTF Games (OTW, HTB, etc.)
1. 1-1 Private Mentoring
1. Bash Scripting 
1. Go Programming
1. Rust Programming

Twitch needs to add a Hacker CTF category.

What if we had entirely remote CTFs that could be monitored on Twitch,
etc?

By the way, I love the word "nudge" from the OffSec world.

Should I alternate day for G0CT and OSCP focused times? One day would be
just for beginners working on G0CT and the other would be for only those
more advanced working on the OSCP specifically.

This also has me thinking that maybe I need to carve out time to talk
with other mentors and educators about helping other people learn. Next
time I get to talk to strager or iscreman25 I'll have to ask them.

Eventually I need to have the schedule for G0CT very specific. But I
really don't need to sweat the specific details details because I can
just change the current topic and most people will be watching the
YouTube videos that result anyway.

There are lots of other questions about making videos, where they should
be published and when. My initial feeling on this is to not push
anything to Twitch, only Youtube, and to keep Twitch for live streaming.
The highlights on Twitch would then be just to redirect to the stuff on
YouTube. YouTube is more sustainable and discoverable for overall
content.

I'm feeling uncomfortable that it's been almost a week since I have
published a YT video, but all this stuff has to be worked out to save
time. For example, had I thought through this just a bit better, I might
not have wasted time on unnecessary videos.
