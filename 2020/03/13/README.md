So here's another take on my selection of callables (things that can be
called from the command line) based on increasing needs and depth:

1. Alias
1. Exported Bash Function
1. POSIX Shell Script
1. Bash Shell Script
1. Perl
1. (Ruby / Python)
1. Go
1. Rust
1. C
1. Assembly

Quickly compared `links` to `lynx` and the Unicode support in `links` is
still far too sketch (and yes the annoying exit confirmation is still
the default). The old `lynx` has been updated to be better even though
it still as a lot of old bloat for unsupported stuff used in the 70s and
80s. The end. Lynx is your friend.
