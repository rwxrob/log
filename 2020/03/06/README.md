Turns out the sound corruption is from OBS Studio. The fix is to exit
OBS completely and the app using sound (usually the web browser) and
then restart the app and restart OBS.

With all the focus on pentesting it has really warped my sense of
software development. For example, learning everything there is to learn
about CSS is simply not needed. Creating the G0CT has been one of the
best thing for [SkilStak]{.spy} because it has really forced me to focus
on *only* those things that have very broad application to all
foundational technology careers. For example, there is no need to learn
Vue or React, only vanilla JavaScript with a *solid* understanding of
the DOM and focus on HTTP (along with other networking).

This is coming up now because even though I stand by the recommendation
to get Jennifer's Learning Web Design book most of it is irrelevant to
the G0CT. It has such solid information in it that everyone should
*eventually* work through the whole thing. But I plan on getting very
specific about the sections and projects that are required just to get a
good initial understanding leading to the certificate evaluated project
of creating a personal/professional web site from scratch with the
minimal requirements:

* Responsive
* Semantic (justify *every* div)
* Pandoc Markdown Generated

The title of the sub-cert, Knowledge Content Creation, also conveys the
goal of it better. Sure understanding cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities will require a lot more JavaScript understanding later,
but not to get started.

In short the G0CT should equally provide a foundation to all of the
following fast-growing career paths:

* Full-Stack PWA Developer
* Senior Software Engineer
* Systems Applications Developer
* Site Reliability Engineer
* Machine Learning Engineer
* Embedded Systems Engineer
* Offensive Security Professional

As I go though the vetting process for all the content I already have
and decide what stays and what goes or gets put into another category or
cert I'll be applying this check list to make sure whatever is there
applies to everything.

Earlier I was struggling a little because I had "Web Developer" in the
list, which does *not* require Linux and command line skills beyond
basic navigation. But a Full-Stack PWA Developer needs much, much more
--- including a full understanding of Bash scripting, HTTP, and the use
of `curl`.
