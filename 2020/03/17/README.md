PicoCTF has an amazing shell interface that can be used from anywhere
there is web access. However, some of the "challenges" require use of
the Unity game plugin. I don't have to say how much I disapprove of
that. 

Also the challenges are not in any particular order and have no notion
of advancement and building on previous skills (like OverTheWire.org).

Concluded the interface beyond that shell is just too kindergarten to
stand for one more second. They actually have you enter data into their
graphic UI, which is *required*. They have a great shell and then never
use it to submit any flags which all have to be submitted through their
graphic user interface (web page) no matter how simple they are.

I seriously disappointed because they setup the shell so perfectly and
then fucked it up by requiring Unity and a React web GUI to even submit
stuff.

I'm seriously disturbed by how completely behind most web development is
today. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) doesn't even
discuss JAMstack or development focused on APIs including GraphQL. I
want to get involved to help them because I love everything else about
their project, but I just can't given the amount of time to get
involved. I would rather provide input to a big project like that
instead of building all my own stuff though.
