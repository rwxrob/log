Having fun with people on OverTheWire.org:


``` lsof -p PID lsof -n | grep pts htop                              #
discover echo -e "\e]11;rgb:ff/00/ff\007"  # color echo -e "\e(0"
# gibberish echo -e "\e[?1003h"               # gibberish echo -e
"\e[<Start>;<End>r"    # scroll region reset
# also reset

```
