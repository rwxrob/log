So streaming has overall been a blast, but there is one serious
down-side. A certain minority think they are experts on everything "you"
should do. Yet they don't have anything of their own. "You need
experience" yet they don't have a single stream or YouTube video to draw
from to back up their authoritative bullshit. 

Thank God for the ban function, which reminds me I need to figure out
how to do it from IRC.

The only way to deal with these types of entitled assholes is to
instantly ban them. I don't care if they are immature gamers who don't
know better. They need a consequence. "What the fuck!? How dare you ban
me? I'm just trying to help."

Go fuck yourself.

I have a zero tolerance policy for ingratitude. There are a ton of other
things I could do with my free time besides provide $100/hour private
consulting content for free on Twitch. I could be making $150/hour as a
CTO or tech consultant IRL. So when some pleeb tells me what to do with
my stream without even offering a single thank you for the time and
money I've sacrified without any agenda and not even seeking advertising
sponsorships that's the only appropriate response.

I hate to make this conclusion, but I keep running specifically into
gamers who fall victim to this phenonemon.
