TIL that <https://prerender.io> is actually be used by absolutely stupid
people who care nothing for blind people and those using text-based
browsers. I have never been more motivated to destroy a site that right
now. These people have no idea about the amount of damage they are
causing the Web and frankly they don't care. 

This is not some idle rant from an aging dinosaur wanting to use a
text-based browser. This is objectively destroying our ability as humans
to search, archive, and access what we have come to love. 

There has never been a time that the README World Exchange is more
needed. Then the world of intelligent humans can be free from the
stupidity of those who would destroy the Web's basic purpose for the
sake of whatever JavaScript grants them.

Just learning about KnowBots today. They are bots that collect knowledge
based on specified criteria and have been around a long time. I really
want to make `know.sh` into a service where people can configured their
own KnowBots.
