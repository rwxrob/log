So looks like <https://overthewire.org> doesn't like having spoilers
posted but I don't feel like I'm "posting" spoilers to be picked up and
found. Anyone can decide not to watch and since I've disabled VODs it's
just me and some friends figuring things out without giving anything
away. It's really no different than someone being with me and just
hanging out working on it.
