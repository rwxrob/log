So there is someone claiming that MI, WI, NC, GA and PA all have Democrat
governors except so I decided to confirm this:

* MI - hell yes, and she is amazing
* WI - definitely, and Trump has people trying to kill her
* NC - confirmed, since I live here
* GA - republican
* PA - democrat

Turns out it is true, which is amazing even if the person making the
claims was arguing that the they are "stealing" the election.

Now is the time people's true nature comes out. Here's one example from
a random good person on Twitter:

> I am in no mood to take the highroad when Republicans have been
> crawling around the muck for five years at least.

And here's my plea to let people change, even those who have made
horrible decisions in the past:

> Yeah, but we really need to. Obama and the Clintons were AGAINST
> things like gay marriage. Not all Republicans are Trump, not by a long
> shot. We have to *let* people change instead of beating them over the
> head with their horrible choices. Please.

God knows I need to follow my own council on this. I have definitely
*not* been this way before. But I see it now more than ever.
