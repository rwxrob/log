Oh. My. God. Where has `xdotool` been all of my life!? I'm so in love. I
can do anything that can done with any input device whatsoever by
using this amazing command. What do disable `screenkey` from
typing out passwords? 

```
xdotool key Control_L Control_R
```

Yep. You can control the keyboard, mouse and anything in between. I'm
in love. This means that in my terminal `live` tool when I focus a
window for chat I can automatically disable `screenkey`
temporarily so there isn't a big conflict for screen real-estate.

I really need to do a series just on creating and maintaining a codebook
and/or notes repo.

Sometimes I just have to remember to chill the fuck out. So much going
on in the world to make a person *not* want to do that right now. I look
forward to starting up my Ashtanga practice again tomorrow. Since the
move my schedule has been really messed up. So much urgency in the air.
But there is cause to be happy, things are looking better for everyone.
