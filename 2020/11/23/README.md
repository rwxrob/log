More than a little annoyed that PopOS broke my man page colors.

I'm randomly annoyed at the sudden memory of a person who just kept my
"loaner" laptop and never contacted me at all after that, he was a
generally nice person but somehow didn't feel the need to return my
property even though we left on good terms.

What the fuck is *wrong* with people? *Good* people.

Sometimes evil has a nice smile on it. The people aren't evil, the ethos
of getting away with as much as possible, that somehow that makes you
smart, that people who commit fraud are somehow charismatic subjects of
movies to be celebrated. Trump is the epitome of this. There's nothing
smart about this thinking. It's fucking evil.
