Even though Paulo Friere would probably despise the term Frerian I think
it pretty much describes the focus I have had from the beginning without
knowing about it. Indeed, there were Frerians long before he ever
existed or wrote *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* but I'm still glad he did.

I really need to update my `grepall` to not use `find` maybe be some
sort of alias just for the following (since this is supported these
days):

```sh
grep -r --exclude-dir={test,build} 'throw' | less -S
```

Need to look into [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/graphql/) for GraphQL
development (when the time comes). Hearing good things about it.

My step-son Otto says that "memes are the DNA of the soul" because they
are passed down like genes except verbally, per Richard Dawkins. We also
watched "meme theory."

I really have been realizing that the way I was helping others learn
Python back in the day via small challenges associated with retro memes
that I was actually fulfilling what science has discovered is the single
greatest way to "get a thought into someone's head."
