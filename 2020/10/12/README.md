I'm reminded today how important learning basic web development skills
is --- definitely before learning any other programming. The reason is
because web development skills fundamentally include learning how to
manage one's own knowledge in whatever form (usually markdown).
Certainly this doesn't require learning much (if any) JavaScript. In
fact, I think it warrants calling it by another name entirely, perhaps
*Web Design* although I find *Web Content Creation* more applicable.

I still wish to make Go the first "real" programming people experience
which leaves me to conclude the following (not finished):

* Using a Computer
  * Touch Typing
    * <https://typing.com>, <https://nitrotype.com>
  * Using a Keyboard and Desktop Interface
  * Using a Mouse (Correctly)
  * Using a USB Stick 

* Using the Internet Safely
  * Knowing How Networks Work
    * Protocols, Ethernet, TCP/IP, UDP, Domain Names, Wifi, HTTP, SSH
  * Using a Web Browser Safely
    * Firefox, Lynx
  * Using Email Safely
    * Protonmail
  * Using Essential Chat and Social Media Safely
    * Discord, Slack, Zoom, Reddit, Newsgroups
  * Managing Your Passwords
    * KeePassXC

* Becoming Proficient with the Linux Terminal
   * Getting Access to a Linux Terminal
   * Accessing a Remote Linux Host with Secure Shell
   * Navigating and Managing Files with Bash Shell
   * Editing Files with Vim
      * Simple Text Tiles
      * Minimal Bash Scripts
   * Executing Files as Scripts

* Practicing the Autodidactic Arts
   * Keeping a Markdown Learning Log
   * Joining the Sharing Economy
   * Setting Up Essential Learning and Communication Services
     * Protonmail, GitLab, GitHub, Twitter, Discord, Slack, Newsgroups,
        Reddit, YouTube, Twitch, Zoom, Skype

* Creating Basic Web Content
   * Knowing the Difference Between Web *Apps* and *Documents*
   * Setting Up a Terminal-Based Web Development Workspace
     * Creating a Hosted Git Repo for Your Site
       * Creating a Development Branch
     * Linking Netlify to Your Git Repo
     * Monitoring Your Development in Real Time
       * Setting Up BrowserSync
       * Setting Up a Staging Server
   * Using Basic HTML Elements
   * Using Basic CSS Styles
   * Using Minimal JavaScript
     * Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)
   * Merging Your Development into Master

* Programming Things (in Go)

I think it is important to emphasize that this initial focus on
programming a computer is *not* software development or software
engineering, which are, of course, critical, but come *after* learning
the essentials of turning algorithms into code.
