Peter had another great recommendation for those considering BSD,
[*Absolute FreeBSD - The Complete Guide to
FreeBSD*](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=*Absolute FreeBSD - The
Complete Guide to FreeBSD*). Then there is
[this](https://papers.freebsd.org/2019/fosdem/looney-netflix_and_freebsd/)
from Dennis. Maybe use the
[MicroEmacs](https://github.com/torvalds/uemacs) that Torvalds uses.
