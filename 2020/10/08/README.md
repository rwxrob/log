The [Quantum
Internet](https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/the-quantum-internet-will-blow-your-mind-heres-what-it-will-look-like)
is going to be an actual thing, absolutely mind-boggling.

I love that when Eric S. Raymond gets around to saying something that
I've been saying since early 2019 that it makes [ZDNet news](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-based-windows-makes-perfect-sense/).

*(What is a "blog" for if not self-pity.)*

Plans for the future:

* <https://robs.io> will continue as is.
t 
* <https://skilstak.io> will become home to the [SkilStak]{.spy}
  personal skills management app.
* <https://rwx.gg> will remain a free progressive knowledge app (a
  knowledge base that is also a progressive web app with localized
  search capability).

This one well-worded paragraph from [Eloquent JavaScript](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Eloquent JavaScript) says
everything I ever could about why I so strongly believe Go is a better
first language than JavaScript to learn *true* programming the right way
-- even as a first language.

> There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript. Many of

There just has to be a better beginning programming book that just so
happens to use Go as the language. Imma write it.

One of the great things about settling on Go as a first language is that
the rest of my documentation can focus on it as the reference language.
This is often a problem when creating knowledge nodes on a general
programming topic but some code is needed to illustrate. Go is the
*perfect* language for such things because it is so "boring" and clear
to read.
