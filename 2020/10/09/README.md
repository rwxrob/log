I just read this Tweet and it sent literally shivers down my spine:

> Today I practised working with back-end JavaScript. I made some
> progress on a small blog app using #Nodejs, express and #MongoDB.

This person is preparing themselves for obsolescence before even
starting a career in tech and they have no idea why that is.
Unfortunately so many others also cannot see why this is so incredibly
bad. It is *so* critical to become a Prescient Technology Professional
today.

The challenge to remaining a PTP is simply the time it takes to do the
research. While meeting other critical life demands I've fallen behind
myself in tracking the core technologies through my different networks.
It seems like there are general categories of time expenditure. Here are
mine:

 Hours/Day       Category
------------    -----------------------------------------------------
  1              Keeping up with major *tech* information sources
  5              Working toward core/work project deadlines (live)
  1              Beginner Boost (live)
  5              Mentoring others
  2              Doing any moderate physical activity
  1              Relaxing, low-stress activities
  1              Eating
  8              Sleeping

This doesn't take into account activities on the weekends.
