Now that I've accepted that I am forever committed to Vimisms, whether I
like it or not, I've become okay trying other new things like
[`vim-airline`](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=`vim-airline`) which
gives quite a nice bit of visual input about the file you are working
with, which is particularly good when streaming and when I have several
panes open at the same time so I can quickly identify what file is open
for editing in each. Another good thing is how the `ex` line stays
visible allowing people who are watching to see what my last command was
rather than asking me to redo it for them.

How do we fix this?

That's the question I keep asking myself over and over again
obsessively. Then, I eventually get disillusioned. Here's why:

**People don't know how to act in others' best interests.** We are had
wired to be selfish. Unless they benefit, they don't *really* give a
shit. I want to believe that isn't true for *me*, but so does everyone
else. This relates to the bigger question: Is there any *true* altruism?
People, even those who *appear* completely and totally selfless are
ultimately doing *everything* for themselves.

**People --- Americans in particular --- have been conditioned to think
self-interest is selfish, at least the perception of such.** Acting in
one's own "self interest rightly understood" is how all of existence is
set up to be. A highly religious person wants to get to Heaven. A
scientist accepts the core motivation in all creatures to survive and
flourish. 

> In this respect I think they frequently fail to do themselves justice,
for in the United States as well as elsewhere people are sometimes seen
to give way to those disinterested and spontaneous impulses that are
natural to man; but the Americans seldom admit that they yield to
emotions of this kind; they are more anxious to do honor to their
philosophy than to themselves.

Not accepting the truth of our innate self-interest causes social
dichotomy leading to hypocrisy, guilt, cognitive dissonance, denial, and
even violent narcissism when such people suddenly realize that
self-interest is okay and others distort this truth into "rational
selfishness" that says even God wants you to live the "affluent life"
shutting out the homeless during hurricanes from your million dollar
mega-churches.

**Society pushes people away from authenticity.** Lately we are seeing a
dark side of this. America is filled with evil, racist, assholes who
would rather kill people they disagree with --- and feel they are
justified by God --- than turn the other cheek. Such people have been
given permission to let out their authentic selves. At least now we know
those people have existed all along. But what if everyone 
behaved in society according to who they *actually* are. At least then
we wouldn't suddenly have a crisis because we could create dialog
earlier *before* our differences break angrily out onto the streets.
Society does not give people permission to openly express themselves and
frankly it never will. This is why we see so many people hide behind
anonymity rather than have an open, public debate and dialog. They would
rather call me a "sweaty autistic" than actually engage (and in that
case it turned out to be a Rust fan-boy troll, no surprise there).

**A minority of greedy people are even more selfish.** These are the
"unenlightened" who --- rather than realizing what is good for society
*is* good for them --- *only* focus on what is good for themselves *at
the cost* of others welfare. These are the "what can I get away with"
people. Ironically, many of these people claim to be extremely
God-fearing good people who are simply using God to justify their
actions that are otherwise bad for everyone else who isn't in their God
club. These are also the "greed is good" people who distort the truths
of enlightened self-interest into "rational selfishness" (Ayn Rand) to
further destroy the world even if that destruction doesn't come until
they are long and dead. I believe this is the major cause of all our
problems today. Rand's works were all the rage for more than a decade
and have shaped societal values worldwide for the worse. This is how
assholes like my last two land-lords are able to say, "I don't do
empathy" while kicking us out despite our perfect payment record and
verbally committing to helping me grow my school. Such people have no
shits to give about others. "It's just good business."

**People can't change people. People change themselves.** One thing Friere
really brings home is how impossible it is to change someone else. The
best we can hope for is to *effect* change in them, but not change them.
Ironically, I learned all about this while training Mormon missionaries.
We focused on the psychological scientific truth of helping someone
"feel the spirit" for themselves and then "inviting" them to make a
commitment based on their own feelings. We learned all about the
conditions that were needed, the safe atmosphere, and how to promote
their confidence that they could, in fact, feel the Spirit of God
speaking to them personally. Even more ironic is how close
this is to Friere's position. To *help* someone change involves becoming
their peer, being willing to learn something from them, helping them
find the confidence to trust in their mind *and* heart, and then "posing
a problem" to be considered and worked on. I've been saying, "You can't
teach anyone, anything" for years. Turns out its true --- despite how
much educators hate hearing it.
