Just realized I've been using the word *verbose* (use a lot of words to
say something) wrongly when *loquacious* (prone to talking a lot) is
almost always a better pick. Often, both apply.

Just read the following in Friere's *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* that
perfectly describes the social conundrum we find ourselves facing today:

> Not infrequently, revolutionaries themselves become reactionary by
falling into sectarianism in the process of responding to the
sectarianism of the Right.

It's clear what is killing us is dogmatic "sectarianism" combined with a
full denial that the people practicing are not, that the "other" side
are the sectarians that have to be overthrown at all costs.

I'm such a dork. I just connected some fun dots. [\@Erikthedev](https://twitch.tv/Erikthedev) is the
same Erik from the GoTime podcast that I've always been meaning to
listen to. He has reached out earlier about GopherCon, which he helped
start and has some publishing contacts with Manning and O'Reilly.
Sometimes I just have to shake my head in disbelief at the serendipity.
He and I chatted a bit over Discord about the need for a beginner Go
book. Seems everyone knows there is a need but is so busy with other
stuff --- because Go is on fire right now --- that pausing to write a
book isn't a priority. Imma make it a priority after I finish Mim and
use `mim` to create the book. 'Cuz goals.
