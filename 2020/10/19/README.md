Just discovered that Mímir is a central figure to the [2019 game God of
War](https://youtu.be/r5CzjYADxZ4?t=1796). I'm loving that it has made it into pop culture.

Just noticed that Microsoft Identify Manger uses that acronym so I will
be sure to never write it in all caps. I can only hope there isn't a
`mim` command already being used.

So I just registered `mim.directory` and `mim.sh` for 10 years and
locked down the `mimdir` org and group on GitHub and GitLab. From now on
I'll be talking about it like this:

Q: What's Mim?  
A: Mim is a decentralized network of knowledge bases written in Mimmark.

Q: What's Mimmark?  
A: A simplified version of Pandoc Markdown that requires only one pass
   to parse and can be learned in 20 minutes.

Q: Why the name Mim?  
A: It has several references including the origin of the word memory and
   the severed head of Mímir, a Norse God of knowledge that Odin used to
   walk around with so he could ask it questions and get wisdom wherever
   he was. In fact, the vocalized version uses the word "Mímir" (instead
   of Alexa or Siri).

As I've been contemplating the KnowledgeNet more and more I wonder if we
could come up with some name for it that is unique and unknown to anyone
else, a word that could be used as a very (like "google") but that
refers to looking things up on it. It would be fun because we could come
up with an independent mascot for it as well.

I'm settled on [mim](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=mim) or [mimdir](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=mimdir):

* Did you put it on Mim?
* Can you find anything on Mim?
* Hey, go mim it and get back to me.
* Have you checked mim? 
* Oh that's on Mim, the mim.directory.

Looks like that is working. It opens up a lot better branding than RWX
even though I liked the "README World Exchange." The key to this is
really getting something catchy that people will remember and want to be
a part of. That way they will produce content for it.

This was a *rough* weekend. I made the mistake of engaging with people
on Twitter with the assumption that perhaps we could have a rational
dialog and debate. Nope. 

Humanity is fucked. 

As much as I can focus on the positive I agree with Friere and others
that the trajectory of humanity currently is absolute oblivion powered
by narcissism, fear, apathy, hypocrisy, and greed. 

Somehow today I am managing to not sob uncontrollably at the travesty of
it all. I wish I could be all nihilistic about it and just accept the
tailspin of suffering and pain destroying our world, but I can't. I was
literally shaking and unable to sleep, at one point I am pretty sure it
was a full on panic attack. Evil is engulfing the world and there seems
to be nothing I can do about it. But damnit, Imma try anyway.

The part that I *hate* the most is how fucking evil religious people
are. They are so far from any values they *say* they believe and don't
give a shit.
