Can I just say how great it is that all these conferences are not
*entirely* online and most are *entirely* free! I have been a huge
anti-conference person for some time. They are just such a huge waste of
time and energy. I know they *seem* fun, but they have never been worth
it to me. I can always just get the same information much faster through
the Internet. Well, that all just got a *lot* more true.

Take for example the JAMstack conference that just ended today. Or the
[Linux Foundation Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux
Conference](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-linux-foundation-announces-the-full-line-up-of-sessions-for-the-open-source-summit--embedded-linux-conference-europe-2020-virtual-experience-october-26---29-open-for-all---anytime-anywhere-301123877.html)
coming up on October 26th. 

I couldn't be more please with this new future for conferences.

Hey look, more [overwhelming
evidence](https://semiengineering.com/making-everything-linux-capable/)
that mastering Linux (and the Bash command line) is a *mandatory* skill
for all technologists.

It is absolutely amazing how effective pair programming is to help even
the youngest to learn during my mentoring sessions. Lately I have really
been emphasizing a hands-off approach letting them do their best, then I
review the code and make corrections while explaining them, then I
delete all the corrections and let them make the same corrections to
solidify their learning. It is *such* a powerful way to master combine
several skills including use of Vim, language syntax, and project
organization.

Nothing like watching a virtual conference to realize the level of
disconnection that has emerged between managed expectations and
perceptions v.s. *real* value. Silicon Valley is an absolute travesty of
over-funded shit, and I'm not the only one who feels that way.
