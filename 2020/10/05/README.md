This move has to be one of the best things that has happened to us in
the last 10 years. We are so minimal that everything is clean and
organized giving us an intense focus. In this room I'm able to use the
full standing position of this great IKEA table that we've had for years
but were unable to use in the smaller place (despite it being a rental
home and this being an apartment complex). I wasn't even planning on
that advantage. I can literally do yoga between sessions or while I'm
watching someone code during a session. It really is amazing.
