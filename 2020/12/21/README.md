Something so simple can make me so happy. I can't believe I totally
forgot about this gem of a `lynx` configuration addition. This open a
graphic browser using the default for the current URL (`.`) or page
(`,`). It saves me so much time.

```lynx
EXTERNAL:http:open %s &:TRUE
```

I really need to do an exhaustive configuration and usage video for
Lynx. It is so superior to everything else.
