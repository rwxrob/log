As I've been reviewing the materials that are out there (and believe me
I've reviewed a lot of them) it has become overwhelmingly clear that I
have to continue my plan to eventually produce very *short* books on the
same topics that I cover in the *Beginner Boost* video series that are
full of beginner exercises that drive the learning of the concepts and
skills covered. As much as I adore *The JavaScript Way* the project is
abysmally bad and disconnected from the material. The source Markdown
uses the horribly non-standard Learn Pub flavor making it impossible to
actually publish with anything more substantial, such as as Pandoc and
LaTeX. In fact, I'm just plain sick and tired of every author not
knowing what language to use to do the writing, not having a common
knowledge syntax (which just brings home the importance of making the
Pandoc Beginner Boost as soon as possible).

I'm a bit annoyed that so much of this stuff *requires* that I do my own
thing because nothing similar exists, or similar things are just off
enough to make them unusable fully. I've made a proposal to the author
of The JavaScript Way about referencing accompanying exercises but I'm
not hopeful.

Also, no one wants to write *good* beginner material and most coders who
write actually really suck at writing. I'm realizing that is my
super-power. Getting the most across with the least amount of
complication (when I have time to edit and do it write and am not just
spewing like I do in these notes). I mean, the content I created and
used over the years at SkilStak is honestly better than all this other
stuff I keep telling myself I need to use because it is already out
there. Time to get my own stuff out there.

Here's another crack at the titles I would eventually want:

* Autodidactic Habits of a Successful Technologist
* Choosing the Best Code Editor for *You*
* Learning the Linux Command Line, A Beginner Boost
* Learning the Vim Editor, A Beginner Boost
* Learning Linux TMUX Terminal Manager, A Beginner Boost
* Learning Lynx Web Browsing, A Beginner Boost
* Learning Web Design, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning to Structure Data, A Beginner Boost
* Learning Pandoc for Personal Publishing, A Beginner Boost
* Learning JavaScript in the Browser, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning Go Programming, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning Bash Scripting, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning Python Programming, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning SQL for PostgreSQL, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning C, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning PEGN for Grammar Creation, A Beginner Boost
* Learning Progressive Web Apps with Vue, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning Docker Containers, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning Git and GitHub, A Beginner Boost 
* Good to Gig: Developer Tools, Services, and Practices
* Learning Kubernetes, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning gRPC Protobuf, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning Embedded Programming in C with Gooligum, A Beginner Boost 
* Learning Embedded Programming in Assembly with Gooligum, A Beginner Boost 

These are all targeted at getting beginners started out right. There are
a few topics I just refuse to cover until I'm forced to, such as the
entire NodeJS/Typescript development falling in the "Full Stack"
category. I simply refuse to help others learn the bloated crap. True
web development doesn't need any of that shit. If someone wants to learn
it there are plenty of resources out there.

I didn't include the book Greg and I have started. 

I really want to keep "learning" in the title because people associate
it with the first in a series. I really love that O'Reilly did that.

Some of these books would be super short, but that is just fine.

Many things came out of the live stream about GitHub destroying the
progress of GitLab, but perhaps the most disturbing is this move by
GitLab to block all of China and Russia from using the service at all:

<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/5555>

The manner in which this was handled is just so out of bounds I don't
have words for it. This is just unthinkable. I cannot support GitLab
after learning that they did this. In fact, this whole thing makes me
seriously question the world-wide hiring paradigm. GitLab has made such
a big deal about being open to everyone in the world, yet they randomly
choose to block certain countries from which espionage is a greater
concern, but still. Who's next? Who decides?

The simple fact of the matter is that GitLab has shown it doesn't
*really* know how to be a multi-national company even though it makes a
big deal about it. Companies like IBM have navigated these issues far
better even if their methods are more conservative. There's a reason
IBM's entire software division is headquartered in Canada.

Need to take a look at Ultralight, which is apparently "what Electron
should have been."
