After a lot of discussion about implications for users not being able to
use something created with MimWorks if the license is banned by a
particular work place, decided to go with GPLv2 (or maybe Affero GPLv2
depending on the specific tool). The decision against permissive
licenses (like the perfectly good Apache 2) is simply because this is
the kind of thing that a malintent corporation (like Google or Apple)
would abuse when it becomes a competitor or cuts into their business,
which I strongly hope it will.
