Discovered an [amazing summary of HTML element
usage](https://www.advancedwebranking.com/html/) while wondering if such
a thing existed to help isolate the key elements from those that are
unimportant.

I also totally forgot about [The HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/)
which is an absolute must have resource.
