I *must* create `rwxcoin` to coincide with the giving of points in my
live stream. It would just be too much fun not to do it. I can offset
the time it takes to process the coin by putting that in a batch
background somehow.

I just have to figure out how to be the only person who can give out the
initial coin as points. Also, it is a good idea to keep the `rwxcoin`
separate from the points on the stream (after they've been given)
because people could start trading in `rwxcoin` to buy time and
influence in the chat without earning it.
