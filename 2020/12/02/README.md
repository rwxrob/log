I fucking hate how rigged the system is. I simply cannot get health
insurance unless I work for a particular type of company, one that is
highly funded by the approved oligarchs of our society. It fucking
sucks. The entire system requires that you make *someone* a lot of
money, no matter what. Perhaps you have something that is going to
fundamentally change how humans communally learn, think, and work. No
one gives a shit.

Even if begging for funding were in my nature it still isn't going to
get my insurance. In fact, it will just frustrate me more because I'll
be paying precious investment money on higher premiums and just working
for a big company simply because I'm not big enough to command the bulk
sales discounts that large corporations can provide.

So the biggest single impediment to my entire plan in getting insurance.
I fucking hate this. God help us all if an advanced society like that of
2020 hasn't even figured out how to keep people universally healthy even
though we spend \$700 billion dollars a year on the military budget.

Udemy sucks for people who know how to create their own apps, which is
not nearly as hard as it used to be. They give creators only 25% of
their says and completely control your content. No way. Not for me.

Nope. Imma make my own app and host all my *good/edited* videos on
Vimeo. I'm even going to be streaming building the whole thing to help
anyone else build their own learning community as well.

Udemy provides searchability. So I'll make a bunch of free content over
there to direct people to the live stream and then to the premium
content. But I'm *never* going to just produce paid content. Instead,
those who want the edited and condensed stuff take from the live
sessions can pay and support the stream and community in the process.

I just had a major break-through. It was one of those moments when
everything just came together. Here's what it was about.

My dharma is creating learning communities. It's building learning labs
and helping others find their way. It leverages all of my skills
together, the technical with the conversational, presentational, and
written aptitudes.

*Not* leveraging my greatest calling and talent is just not acceptable
no matter what my perceived needs are (insurance, for one). I simply
must follow through and have the faith that, as Christians say, "the
Lord (Universe) will provide." But I have to have a plan, and that plan
has become crystal clear within the last hour.

The basis of the plan is the promotion of communal learning in a sharing
economy. It includes the following foundations:

* Free and open credentials focused on industry needs
* Free learning labs live streamed to every platform
* Paid content derived from edited live learning labs
* Building of free progressive learning app with DLC
* Crowdfunding additional support for the effort
* Community-building merch to subsidize the effort
* Focus on helping others build their own communities

This is just RWX all over again. Thinking back about 2020 I realize that
this contains the original goals I started and had to back away from
because, well, life happened. But the world needs this more now than
ever.

Here's my action plan as of today:

1. Organize *all* live streams into topical sessions about something
   that can later be edited and published as a PWA
2. Stream as much as possible the learning and development of all the
   pieces including the very learning app itself
3. Prioritize the live stream topics based on what is in the critical
   path to monetization and/or employment

I hate writing that because it sounds like I'm unemployed. I'm not.

Off the cuff, this means I need to focus on the following
as simultaneously as possible:

1. Beginner Boosts 
   * Autodidactic Habits of a Successful Technologist
   * Workthrough: Introduction to Linux
   * Workthrough: Learning Web Design (JAMStack)
   * Workthrough: Eloquent JavaScript
   * Workthrough: Head First Go
   * (rest are secondary)
   * Workthrough: Creating a Platformer Game in Phaser3
   * Workthrough: FCC, Responsive Web Design
   * Workthrough: Bash Man Page
   * Workthrough: Google Bash Style Guide
   * Workthrough: Tour of Go
   * Workthrough: Exercism Go
   * Workthrough: FCC, Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript
   * Workthrough: Head First C
   * Workthrough: Mastering Algorithms in C
   * Workthrough: Gooligum Embedded Programming, Assembly
   * Workthrough: Gooligum Embedded Programming, C
   * Workthrough: OverTheWire, Bandit
   * Workthrough: PicoCTF
1. Experienced Exploring
   * Go Topical (Contexts, etc.)
   * gRPC
   * Git Proficiency
   * websockets
   * Containerd (Docker)
   * Kubernetes
   * Redis
   * Oauth2
1. Advanced Activities
   * Developing the `live` Command for Live Streamers
   * Developing the RWX Portal and PWA
   * Developing Open Credential Specifications
   * Developing PEGN
   * Developing Mim, the Knowledge Network
     * Mimark (a faster Pandoc replacement)

I'm sure the list will grow, but that is a start to I can keep track of
stuff.

After reading through the YouTube partner policies for advertising
content I realized there is no way in hell I will ever seek to be a
YouTube partner. There are just too many mines to avoid, not just
profanity. I can't even talk about what YouTube deems controversial
material, but what is the point of talking about important issues
dialogically if you are going to get slammed.

This leaves me with the following options to actually pay for the time
and energy it takes to do this stuff:

* Merch
* Crowdfunding
* Grants
* Udemy
* Books

The point is to have the activity fund itself, not some other activity
that funds this activity. For example, in the case of helping beginners
to learn JavaScript the best option seems to be supporting
<https://eloquentjavascript.net> through a Udemy course (since the
content is entirely creative commons licensed). I would make my live
streams free while I am recording the raw content, but the edited
content would then go on Udemy. People have the option of watching the
unedited stuff anytime, anywhere, but the Udemy polished content would
cover the general cost to make it. Over time the Udemy money would
counter the time investment. It's just a matter of running some numbers
to see how long it would take to recoup the time investment.

Need to look into `xwinwrap` in order to make a video into the GNOME
background.
