Locked down some URLs. Some for the newly formed Association of
Federated Knowledge Workers:

* <https://afk.works>
* <https://gitlab.com/afkworks>
* <https://github.com/afkworks>
* <https://twitter.com/afkworks>

And some for the main MimWorks tools developed under the AFKWorks
organization:

* <https://mim.works>
* <https://mim.directory>
* <https://mim.sh>
* <https://gitlab.com/mimworks> 
* <https://github.com/mimworks> 
* <https://twitter.com/mimirworks>

I think MimWorks is the best name for the framework that includes all of
the major components and efforts:

* MimWorks Markdown Editor
* MimWorks Knowledge Browser
* MimWorks Knowledge Manager (including Search)
* MimWorks Collaborator
* MimWorks Learning Assistant
* MimWorks Career Manager (Dharma Director)
* MimWorks Metrics
* MimWorks Modules

It seems best to put all of this under a sponsoring non-profit
association to which people can contribute freely and get tax breaks and
stuff. So far here's the best name I can come up with (that is unique):

* Association of Federated Knowledge Workers (AFKWorks)

"Federated knowledge" is knowledge that is separate --- owned and
controlled primarily by individuals --- but shared and combined in a
federated way without centralization of any kind just as Git is a
federated source management tool.

The nod to `afk` is nice because it implies that organizing away from
the keyboard for the benefit of all human knowledge workers is actually
a thing people can do. In fact, I suspect the first time we organize a
knowledge worker strike that the AFKWorks acronym might even transform
into a slogan.

Yeah, I'm pretty damn proud that I came up with that all by my little
self. I'm kinda good with words, even when I spell them wrong.

Just discovered [The Association of Knowledge Workers,
Lucknow](https://akwl.org) which appears to never have taken off, but
just started last year. It's no coincidence that knowledge workers all
over the world are beginning to organize, just like labor did at the
start of the industrial age.

In 1959, [Peter Drucker, in his book The Landmarks of Tomorrow, appears
to have coined the term]() "knowledge worker" even though it is the
natural best description today. Frankly, Drucker's definition is fucking
stupid, the product of a hyper-inflated, white male ego with an early
1960s ethos. In his mind only those involved in "theory and analysis"
qualified. That's bullshit. A home-maker is a knowledge worker. A
teacher is a knowledge worker. And yes, a scientist is a knowledge
worker. In fact, the most important knowledge workers of any age are
those who discover their knowledge through practical, autodidactic
exploration and apply it pragmatically and immediately to solve real
problems facing us and our world. Drucker's ivory tower definition
deserves to be thrown in the trash-heap of history along with his book
and most of the rest of everything created based on 1950s ideologies.
The 50s, not unlike the Catherine era, was one of the worst times in
human history from which we have still not recovered.

So much came out of the last live stream:

* Revisited the Knowledge Net architecture
* Discussed the problems of modern society from Google, etc.
* Realized (again) this is too big for just me to do
* Had the idea for organizing *The Association of Knowledge Workers*

My wife just made the observation that we are really facing the same
time as the 1930s during the industrial revolution when labor was
formed because big business was stepping on its employees and everything
else in the world without any consequences. We have the exact same thing
happening now, but in a different way. Today's evil railroad and
manufacturing companies are almost all in Silicon Valley. They don't
necessarily need to fall, but they do need a kick in the ass.

What did the people do then?

They organized.

I'm having one of those moments in life that people refer to as an
epiphany. It feels like every second of my life has led up to this
moment, every decision, every action, every single thing I have learned,
including my French and Russian language skills. Revolution *is* coming
and I realize that I can at least be a catalyst for it as it happens.
Linux was revolutionary. The Web was revolutionary. And we need to
organize and create ideas and solutions to revolutionize how knowledge
workers live their lives.

A quick glance at the Web reveals that people have been [thinking about
the plight of knowledge worker
efficiency](https://www.amanet.org/articles/struggling-to-manage-knowledge-workers/)
for some time. Certainly this is the goal of MimWorks, but the larger
issue has nothing to do with technology. It is a social issue, a labor
issue.

One thing is for sure, such a movement cannot start within the
"hermetically sealed happy-town" that is Google (or companies like it)
even though the workers there are the most exploited. It will be better
to form outside the reach of such juggernauts. Besides, knowledge
workers *includes* educators as well as those paid 10x their salaries
for having sold their souls. These companies understand the efficiency
issue and make "dashboards" (IBM) to "increase knowledge worker
productivity" but they do *nothing* to federate knowledge and promote
universally beneficial ways to capture, collect, and share knowledge
outside the scope of that specific company.

Plus this whole conversation directly attacks the notion that any
organization owns *all* knowledge a worker acquires while employed with
that organization. Indeed, no enterprise should have that level of power
and the only way to make greedy companies see this is to organize the
human labor that provides its collective knowledge to empower such
organizations to provide the wake-up call to these companies stating.

"Our knowledge is ours. We *are* your power."

My not-so-evil-plan-to-change-the-world is to organize knowledge workers
empowering them in every way possible. It's been my plan all along, but
the details have only gradually been revealed.

Started the first live stream for *Designing Mim, a Framework for
Decentralized Knowledge Management*. The more I thought about it all day
(and drew pretty diagrams) the more I see the relation between all the
components that described in the previous note:

Component|Description
-|-
MimBase|Knowledge management
MimWork|Life's work manager
MimSkilz|Personal learning assistant
MimDir|Light listing of MimBases

I'm realizing the last 10 years of my life have been informally
dedicated to promoting personal learning and knowledge management and
sharing systems and applications.
