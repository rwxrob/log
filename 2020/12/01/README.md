I'm finally hitting some nasty hanging `pandoc` errors due to the size
of my running notes file. I've known I would hit this day and in the
past have come up with all kinds of more intelligent approaches to the
whole thing. It doesn't take a genius to know that rotating a massive
single Markdown page once is a while is a good thing. But doing so
removes the extreme ease with which I can find notes just using simple
search from within `vim` or `grep`. I don't suppose even grepping
multiple files is that hard either. But what I *really* want is what
I've already designed: a system for keyword matching based on the
lexicon of the entire thing that looks for specific words within
proximity to one another, not directly next to each other.

Still, I can't help but realize how limited and frankly broken `pandoc`
is for the use case I have and why Mim, my Knowledge Net idea really
needs to become a reality.

I'm pretty fucking annoyed that I cannot complete the stuff I *want* to
work on because of the constraints of learning and maintaining skills
that are employable. A lot of the stuff I'm interested in making is
stuff that world doesn't even know it needs or wants yet. But so often
when they do hear about the designs they want it *now*. So do I.

I'll go ahead and rotate these notes by year. The end of this one is
fast approaching.

Need to consider [Helm](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Helm) and [Kustomize](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Kustomize) and other visualization and
template creation tool for Kubernetes on this "over-engineered live
stream utility".
