Having amazing people in my little mentored community makes all the
difference. These five hours a day are a *breeze*. They really fly by.
That is a significant difference from the past and it allows me to
*really* focus on hard-core work during the day. I'm really looking
forward to wrapping up my major projects over the next few months and
finding some challenging contract work to supplement the mentoring. I've
been more than a bit picky with the work options, however. No fucking
Java, PHP, Node, C++ or C# unless it is to port that shit *off* of it.
Also nothing for any brain-dead organization that actually thinks a
CompTIA certs matters for *anything*.
