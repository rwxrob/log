Been giving a lot of thought recently to what sort of employment I
really want now that we've decided that I will be seeking work outside
of SkilStak in order to get a home (instead of renting as we have been
doing). As usual, it is hard to isolate what I would like to do from all
that I *could* do --- especially with all my experience at this point. I
find myself following my own council from my mentoring and streaming:

1. "What is your mission in life?
1. "What activities do you enjoy doing daily?"
1. "What careers involve those activities?"
1. "What companies employ for those careers?"
1. "What do these companies specific need to see to trust me?"
1. "What core skills are most important for those careers?"
1. "Which core skills do I know or need to learn?"
1. "What is the best way to learn those skills?"

As I ponder the perfect position I'm allowing myself to consider the
sort-of anti-employment as well. A friend of mine on the Twitch stream
insists that I should freelance. I really want to consider it. But I
need to meet the needs of employment to pass for a mortgage and that is
*incredibly* hard in today's climate without a traditional employer.

### The Perfect Day

I already have the perfect job. I wake up. Make coffee. Blog and code
and live stream while I'm doing it. I have a one-hour educational stream
for everyone on Twitch during that time and later clean up that video
for release onto YouTube. I organize those videos into a living
curriculum covering beginner boost topics as well as highly advanced
software design put into practical terms. My evenings I spend time
directly mentoring and pair programming. At least two hours is spent
outside just walking or slow running and pondering life and projects.
Another 90 minutes I spend doing Yoga. I walk the dog and spend time
with my wife throughout the day. I read in the morning during breakfast
and at night going to bed. And I am paid for all of it either directly
or by patrons who want to see my projects completed.

How do I get someone to pay me to continue to do what I *already* do?

For most the answer is "become a professor" but that path is so fraught
with problems it is unthinkable. It is such a tragedy that education
institutions suck so completely today. 

No, I need something that allows me to be professor-like but receive the
remuneration of a corporate employee. Unfortunately, such companies are
large and usually very evil, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM.
Ironically I find IBM and Microsoft the most palatable of the bunch. IBM
would want to patent everything I have been making lately. Microsoft,
is, well, Microsoft.

### Cybersecurity Engineering

A natural extension of my expertise creating large-scale applications
for systems monitoring and audit compliance is *cybersecurity
engineering*. It involves engineering software (and sometimes hardware)
solutions for both penetration testing and defensive remediation. I can
totally do that shit (and already have).

My Golang mastery really compliments this because Go is *the perfect*
language for such applications for all the obvious reasons that anyone
serious in the field would immediately recognize.

### Perfect Title

Senior Software Architect specializing in SRE and cybersecurity
solutions particularly involving grammar and knowledge design and
development.
