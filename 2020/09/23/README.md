I've come to understand that parents --- no matter how well intentioned
--- just do not have the time to do basic things like read policy
documents. I'll need to adapt at some point, or not. The older the
members of my mentored community the less this seems to be an issue.

I also need to tone down my policy document. I wrote it clearly in
reaction to the very few bad parents that make me required to have such
strict and spelled out policies.

Sometimes it worries me, then I look at the monumental successes of
those who have been in the community for a few years and I feel better.
It is harsh. I'm harsh. But it has objectively proven to be a good thing
for everyone who stays.
