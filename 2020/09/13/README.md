Need to read [Good Enough
Software](https://www.liamwho.com/wp-content/uploads/When-Good-Enough-Software-Is-Best.pdf)
from Ed Yourdon. Someone mentioned it after I went off about being
called a "water boiler" by worst manager of my life at IBM just for
raising critical issues with a bug I had notified people about in email
before. God I'm glad I never work with that asshole again. I had so many
other wonderful managers at IBM. He was *not* one of them.
