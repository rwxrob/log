TIL you can include `type blah struct{}` declarations within blocks in
Golang but you *cannot* give them receiver methods. For that you have to
put them outside of a block. It's a small thing, but definitely made me
go, "Humm."

Shared `tmux` sessions are the *only* way to pair program as far as I'm
concerned. The level of ability to monitor and directly help someone is
overwhelming. Plus there are no fucking streaming problems, just
pristine voice calls that use relatively low bandwidth. Everything from
helping to configure `.vimrc` to adding a bunch of `FIXME` comments is a
breeze during live mentoring sessions. It is not an exaggeration to say
that *every* alternative is inferior by several orders of magnitude. I
pity the world and those who will never discover this amazing truth.
