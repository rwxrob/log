After much consideration I'm all but decided to work for the *really*
good contracting company of some kind. Discussing it with great people
doing it professionally on the Twitch stream has really convinced me
that is the thing for someone with my diverse and extensive experience
to do. Hell, I may even be able to use my non-computer language skills.

I'll be in finish up and clean up mode for at least the rest of 2020 as
I wrap up projects, dust off and polish the old ones, and throw out the
really old stuff. I also need to make extensive updates to my LinkedIn
and resume. It is not an exaggeration to say I've been so busy helping
others that my own good-to-gig status has fallen behind some --- not
from lack of experience --- but from lack of updating what are
essentially the personal marketing materials everyone has to maintain to
garner interest from potential compatible employers.

Woah, it's September 11th. Just noticed. That certainly brings back
poignant memories.

Found the part where [Bryan Cantrill talks about his obsession with old
languages](https://youtu.be/HgtRAbE1nBM?t=1136).
