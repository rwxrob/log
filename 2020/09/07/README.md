Noticing during the process of AST and grammar design that a few
questions help to decide how to organize your tree and nest the nodes:

* Would this make sense as an attribute (if attributes were supported)?
If so, it should likely be a subnode of a parent. In fact, anything that
could be represented differently by attributes should all be subnodes of
the same parent node type.

I really need to include "The Mormon Fixer in St. Petersburg" as a
chapter in the book I eventually write about being Mormon. The mission
president in St. Petersburg also coincidentally happened to be my
favorite and most influential professor in all my time at Brigham Young
University. He was also quietly *very* liberal. Sometimes I wonder how
he managed to stay Mormon having written the plays he had. I once had to
defend him to his own students who about revolted with he came to the
part of his history course where he presented the African coming-of-age
myths involving 90 foot penises. Oh my god, I'm still laughing about it
now. These little straight-A Mormons couldn't handle the myths of the
world and revolted almost getting him in trouble with administration
(again). He had a long record of rabble-rousing. Maybe that's why he was
my favorite.
