So I applied to Linkedin for streaming and am feeling remorse for using
so many swear words on my streams. I am back to finding as many *other*
words as possible. I realize it is unprofessional in so many circles but
I also don't want to pretend that such words are not okay with me (and
millions of others) to use.
