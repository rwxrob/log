Dawn Waldau (<mailto:dwolford1@mac.com>) lied to PayPal and convinced
them to "return" \$1500 of my money for this I have proven attendance
records and work on my servers with timestamps indicating the dates of
login. PayPal sided with her even though she openly violated
https://skilstak.io/policy and I had to remove her son for openly and
blatantly breaking several rules and being regularly more than 20
minutes late. I have video evidence of all of it. Yet somehow this lying
bitch convinced PayPal to give her my money that earned over several
hours with her children. It is because of people like this person who
feels completely justified in her theft, who thinks somehow she won,
that she got away with something, that I will never fucking to mentoring
for such people again. I look forward to her realizing what a huge
fucking mistake she has made. Her children have seen everything she has
done and they will ultimately be the vehicle by which she gets the
justice she so deserves.
