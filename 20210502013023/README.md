I really don't care about anything but Linux now. One of the motivations
for doing everything in Go (which overcomplicates stuff that could
easily be done as POSIX shell scripts) is that I want it to work
anywhere. But POSIX shell scripts work *everywhere* even on systems
where there might not even be a Go binary that can be compiled for it.
So everything but UNIX/Linux can fuck right off. Go is a great language
and I love it for all the many things that it is best for, but the UNIX
philosophy wins the day. Go is very frequently an over-complication.
