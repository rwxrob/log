"Karen" is at it again threatening to sue for her \$281 refund plus 28%
interest for the "personal loan" even though her son regularly violated
policy, hardly ever came on time, and begged that I keep her son even
after asking to remove him over two years ago (all of which I have on
record). I referred to her (not by name) in the refund notification as
the single best example of why I will *never* do private mentoring
again, ever. It is entitled, rich assholes like her that ruin it for
everyone else.
