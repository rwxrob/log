Luhmann had 90,000 slips in his "slip box". I'm starting to think that I
might surpass that just from all the stuff over the last eight years
that I still have to port into mine. Guess we'll see how it holds up. So
far the digital version is likely to hold out better and be easier to
move around. Can you imagine lugging all those boxes around. Must have
been terrifying to think that at any minute someone could spill coffee
on your Zettelkasten and destroy everything. God bless computers. God
bless Git (and even GitHub).
