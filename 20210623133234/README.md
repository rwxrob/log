Really thinking hard about the multi-language support in CmdBox and how
it might be a fundamentally flawed premise because so many languages do
not even have a left-to-right way. I really need the perspective from
someone who might possibly want language support in such a way. This is
the part where I'm really sorry I learned Russian and French in college
and not at least Chinese as well.
