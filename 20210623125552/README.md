After catching up on Discord a bit I'm thinking of producing all the
boost videos and Git repo on USB sticks after we wrap 2021 Boost. That
way people could get it who don't have Internet or be able to take them
around with them. Whatever the cost, it would minimally support the
stream. Also thinking after finishing that it would be time to approach
a publisher for a book, but probably not. I wouldn't do it unless they
kept completely away from my work to release things under creative
commons online. I'm thinking I'd let them charge for the book, but
that the Boost outline and videos would remain free. Problem is that
there is so much content that the book(s) would be huge. It's possible
that could do booklets that combined make up the entire Boost. Doing
this would mean covering the topics in depth rather than saying, "go
look this up" but I don't know.
