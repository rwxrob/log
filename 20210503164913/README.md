Writing the `zet` script in POSIX means I could run it on a BusyBox
volume with a bind-mount from any system that has docker. My god that
makes me happy. Hell, I almost want to create such a container that has
Emacs in it just to show how fucking cool that is. I'm setting up my
work laptop and that means that I can pull down my zet repo (which
should probably be a `zet` subcommand) and start working with it very
easily. It means write access to my ZK repo from pretty much anywhere
with very little setup overhead.
